### [1] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI是一个开源视频标注软件，专门用于标注动物行为和交互，填补了现有工具在交互标注方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源标注工具要么只支持行为标注而不定位个体，要么只定位个体而不支持交互标注，无法满足理解社交和个体化动物行为的需求。

Method: 开发了SILVI软件，整合了行为标注和交互标注功能，直接在视频数据中进行标注，生成适合计算机视觉模型训练的结构化输出。

Result: SILVI能够有效标注行为和交互，为精细行为分析提供自动化方法，虽然主要针对动物行为开发，但也可用于标注人类交互。

Conclusion: SILVI通过连接行为生态学和计算机视觉，促进了自动化精细行为分析方法的发展，软件已在GitLab上开源提供。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [2] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在训练过程中使用基础噪声注入技术（高斯、散斑、泊松和椒盐噪声）来提高深度学习模型在COVID-19胸部X光检测中的分布外泛化能力，显著缩小了分布内和分布外评估之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在图像识别中往往无法泛化到来自不同设备、人群等的数据，特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中，模型会学习利用特定来源的伪影而非合理的生物标志物，导致在分布外数据上性能下降。

Method: 在训练过程中应用四种基础噪声注入技术：高斯噪声、散斑噪声、泊松噪声和椒盐噪声，以增强模型对分布变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，噪声注入技术能够显著降低分布内和分布外评估之间的性能差距，从0.10-0.20降至0.01-0.06，这一结果基于十个随机种子在AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等关键指标上的平均值。

Conclusion: 基础噪声注入技术是一种有效的方法，能够提高深度学习模型在COVID-19胸部X光检测中的分布外泛化能力，减少模型对特定来源伪影的依赖。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [3] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了模仿学习在X射线引导脊柱手术中的应用，开发了高真实度模拟环境，训练了基于视觉信息的插管对齐策略，在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，并能泛化到复杂解剖结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模仿学习方法在复杂的X射线引导脊柱手术（如脊柱器械植入）中的适用性，因为多视角X射线解读具有挑战性，需要验证这种方法在生物平面引导插管插入中的可行性。

Method: 开发了高真实度的X射线引导脊柱手术模拟环境，收集了正确轨迹和对应生物平面X射线序列的数据集，训练了基于视觉信息的模仿学习策略，用于规划和开环控制插管的逐步对齐。

Result: 策略在68.5%的情况下首次尝试成功，能够安全地维持椎弓根内轨迹，泛化到包括骨折在内的复杂解剖结构，对不同的初始化保持鲁棒性，在真实生物平面X射线上的测试也产生了合理的轨迹。

Conclusion: 初步结果有前景，但存在入口点精度等限制，完整的闭环控制需要更频繁的反馈机制。通过更强的先验知识和领域知识，这类模型可能为未来轻量级、无需CT的机器人术中脊柱导航提供基础。

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [4] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于轻量级YOLOv12的实时目标检测框架，结合自对抗训练和专用数据增强策略，用于沙漠环境中的垃圾检测，在精度和效率方面取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球垃圾危机日益严重，传统垃圾收集方法在偏远或恶劣环境（如沙漠）中效率低下且危险。现有研究主要关注城市环境和可回收材料，忽视了有机和危险垃圾以及沙漠等未充分探索的地形。

Method: 基于剪枝后的轻量级YOLOv12，集成自对抗训练（SAT）和专用数据增强策略，构建实时目标检测框架。

Result: 使用DroneTrashNet数据集，在精度、召回率和平均精度方面取得显著改进，同时实现低延迟和小模型尺寸，适合在资源受限的无人机上部署。与最先进的轻量级YOLO变体相比，在准确性和效率方面达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 结果验证了结合数据中心和模型中心增强方法在沙漠环境中实现稳健实时垃圾检测的有效性。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [5] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于类别的图像合成方法，通过将同一类别的多张图像融合成复合图像来增强训练样本的信息密度和类内方差，显著提高了在不平衡小数据集上的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模、不平衡数据集和低质量输入图像导致深度学习模型预测错误率高的问题，特别是在医学影像诊断领域。

Method: 提出Class-Based Image Composition方法，将同一类别的多张图像融合成复合输入图像(CoImg)，构建平衡数据集Co-OCTDL，使用VGG16模型进行对比实验。

Result: 在OCT视网膜扫描数据集上，该方法实现了近乎完美的准确率(99.6%)、F1分数(0.995)和AUC(0.9996)，显著降低了错误预测率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理类别不平衡和小样本问题，即使在弱数据集上也能产生高质量的预测结果。

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [6] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种互补的时间动作定位方法：边界距离回归(BDR)通过有符号距离回归提供信息理论上的最优定位，自适应时间细化(ATR)通过连续深度选择分配计算资源，在减少计算量的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间动作定位方法对所有边界采用统一计算，但不同边界的难度存在显著差异，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 1. 边界距离回归(BDR)：用有符号距离回归替代分类，提供更尖锐的边界峰值；2. 自适应时间细化(ATR)：通过连续深度选择τ∈[0,1]分配计算，实现端到端可微分优化。

Result: BDR在THUMOS14上实现43%更尖锐的边界峰值，为现有方法带来1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7提升；ATR在162G FLOPs下达到56.5% mAP@0.7，相比均匀处理的53.6%提升2.9%同时减少18%计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应计算分配显著提升了时间动作定位的效率和精度，边界异质性越大效果越明显，在短动作上提升达4.2%，且通过知识蒸馏保持99%性能的同时降低训练成本。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

### [7] [Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950)
*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一处理几何和外观优化的方法，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角图像3D重建方法通常要么优先考虑几何精度（多视角立体），要么优先考虑照片级真实感渲染（新视角合成），往往将几何和外观优化解耦，这阻碍了下游编辑任务。

Method: 提出一个新颖框架，通过高斯引导的网格可微分渲染同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面）和顶点颜色，利用输入图像的光度一致性和从法线和深度图获得的几何正则化。

Result: 获得了高质量的3D重建结果，可以进一步用于下游编辑任务，如重新照明和形状变形。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了几何和外观的联合优化，为3D编辑、AR/VR和数字内容创建等应用提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

### [8] [A Linear Fractional Transformation Model and Calibration Method for Light Field Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03962)
*Zhong Chen,Changfeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于线性分数变换参数的轻场相机内参标定方法，通过解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，包含最小二乘解析解和非线性优化，在物理和仿真数据上验证了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻场相机内参标定是3D重建的关键但具有挑战性的前提条件，需要准确解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列的参数。

Method: 引入线性分数变换参数α来解耦主镜头和微透镜阵列，包括基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，同时提出了从原始图像中检测特征的方法。

Result: 在物理和仿真数据上的实验验证了所提方法的性能，基于该模型的原始轻场图像仿真速度更快，对数据驱动的深度学习方法至关重要。

Conclusion: 提出的线性分数变换参数方法有效解决了轻场相机内参标定问题，提高了仿真效率，为深度学习应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
website.

### [9] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个合成数据集Room Envelopes，用于训练单目几何估计器预测可见表面和结构布局表面，以理解场景范围和物体形状位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，导致不完整的重建结果。场景的结构元素（如墙壁、地板、天花板）相对容易预测，因为它们通常是平面、重复且简单的，因此需要成本较低的方法。

Method: 创建合成数据集Room Envelopes，提供RGB图像和两个关联的点云图：一个捕捉可见表面，另一个捕捉移除家具后的结构布局表面。这为前馈单目几何估计器提供直接监督。

Result: 该方法能够直接监督前馈单目几何估计器，使其能够同时预测第一可见表面和第一布局表面。

Conclusion: 这种方法能够理解场景的范围以及其中物体的形状和位置，为场景结构元素的重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [10] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究发现人类通过3D姿态信息进行社交互动判断，而大多数AI视觉模型缺乏这种能力。通过提取3D关节位置和面部方向等简单空间特征，可以显著提升AI模型的社交判断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何从视觉输入中快速提取社交互动信息，以及为什么当前先进的AI视觉系统在社交互动识别方面仍然面临挑战。

Method: 结合最先进的姿态和深度估计算法，从日常人类行为视频中提取3D关节位置，并与AI视觉模型进行比较。还开发了一套紧凑的3D社交姿态特征描述符。

Result: 3D关节位置在预测人类社交判断方面优于大多数AI视觉模型。简单的3D社交姿态特征与完整关节集具有相同的预测能力，并能显著提升现成AI模型的性能。

Conclusion: 人类社交场景理解依赖于3D姿态的显式表征，可以通过简单、结构化的视觉空间基元来支持。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

### [11] [CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992)
*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaRF是一个完全可微的框架，直接在3D高斯空间中操作，实现多视角一致性，通过引入高斯场相机编码和训练配对视角监督来解决现有方法在跨视角一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射分割方法依赖2D渲染伪监督和视角特定特征学习，导致跨视角一致性不足，需要开发能够直接在3D高斯空间中操作并保持多视角一致性的方法。

Method: 提出高斯场相机编码(GFCE)将相机几何融入高斯文本交互，显式建模视角依赖变化；引入训练配对视角监督(ITPVS)在训练期间对齐校准视图间的高斯对数概率，缓解单视角过拟合并优化视角间差异。

Result: 在三个代表性基准测试中，CaRF在Ref LERF、LERF OVS和3D OVS数据集上分别比最先进方法平均提升了16.8%、4.3%和2.0%的mIoU。

Conclusion: CaRF实现了更可靠和视角一致的3D场景理解，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在益处。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

*Yihao Luo,Xianglong He,Chuanyu Pan,Yiwen Chen,Jiaqi Wu,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Yuanming Hu,Guang Yang,ChoonHwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，实现近乎无损的几何保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于等值面的体素化表示严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，不可避免地损害几何保真度，需要一种能保持尖锐特征和内部结构的准确高效表示方法。

Method: 提出稀疏体素化表示Faithful Contouring，设计双模式自编码器，支持任意网格的高分辨率表示，无需场函数转换或等值面提取。

Result: 在表示方面达到10^{-5}级别的距离误差；在网格重建方面，Chamfer距离减少93%，F-score提高35%，超越了现有方法的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring作为3D学习任务的表示方法具有卓越的保真度，在纹理化、操作和编辑方面表现出灵活性，支持可扩展和细节保持的形状重建。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

### [13] [A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Biometric Authentication from Low-Frame-Rate PPG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04037)
*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于PPG信号的轻量级生物认证框架，使用低帧率指尖视频提取PPG信号，通过连续小波变换将一维信号转换为时频图，并开发了CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合深度学习模型，在46名受试者上实现了98%的认证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号因其无创采集、固有活体检测特性和适用于低成本可穿戴设备而受到生物认证领域的关注，但信号质量易受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异影响，需要稳健的特征提取和分类方法。

Method: 采用标准预处理流程（基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样和幅度归一化），通过连续小波变换将PPG信号转换为时频图，开发了结合空间特征（CVT和ConvMixer）和时间特征（LSTM）的混合深度学习模型。

Result: 在46名受试者的CFIHSR数据集上实验，实现了98%的认证准确率，验证了模型对噪声和个体间变异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该认证系统具有高效性、可扩展性和固有活体检测能力，非常适合现实世界的移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix是一个端到端的多模态语言锚定视觉-大脑对齐框架，通过将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，并将视觉和大脑表示投影到共享潜在空间，实现视觉-语言和大脑-语言嵌入的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将神经活动直接与视觉嵌入对齐，但纯视觉表示往往无法捕捉潜在的语义维度，限制了可解释性和深度鲁棒性。

Method: Bratrix将视觉刺激分解为层次化视觉和语言语义组件，使用可学习的语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态相关性，采用两阶段训练策略（单模态预训练后多模态微调），并包含不确定性感知模块处理噪声神经信号。

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和字幕生成任务上优于现有最先进方法，在200-way EEG检索任务中特别提升了14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过多模态语言锚定方法有效解决了神经信号解码中的语义理解挑战，显著提升了视觉-大脑对齐的性能。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种无配对自监督CT图像去噪方法：基于CycleGAN的残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器。在相同评估协议下，CycleGAN表现最佳，将图像质量从34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM提升至38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在无配对和自监督情况下进行CT图像去噪，评估两种训练数据效率高的方法，为缺乏干净配对数据的情况提供解决方案。

Method: 使用CycleGAN残差翻译器和Noise2Score分数匹配去噪器两种方法，通过配置扫描确定最佳参数设置，并采用标准U-Net架构进行训练。

Result: CycleGAN在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现最佳，Noise2Score在噪声较大输入时也有显著改善。CycleGAN获得1.9441估计分数和1.9343未见集分数。

Conclusion: CycleGAN提供最强的最终图像质量，而Noise2Score作为无配对替代方案具有稳健性能，特别适用于无法获得干净配对数据的情况。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像合成方法未能充分利用位置信息，导致对对象空间布局理解不足，难以实现精确的对象定位控制。

Method: 提出SpatialLock框架，包含两个组件：位置参与注入(PoI)通过注意力层直接整合空间信息；位置引导学习(PoG)使用基于感知的监督进一步优化对象定位。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在精确对象定位方面达到新的最先进水平，在多个数据集上IOU得分超过0.9。

Conclusion: SpatialLock能够生成具有精确空间排列的对象，并提高生成图像的视觉质量，为文本到图像合成中的对象定位问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG)训练免费策略，通过将分类器免费引导(CFG) ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，显著加速扩散采样同时保持高保真生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散求解器未能充分利用额外引导分支对数值误差的鲁棒性，存在大量计算冗余，需要开发更高效的采样方法。

Method: 将CFG ODE重新表述为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在精细时间步网格上积分（乌龟方程），额外引导仅在粗网格上积分（野兔方程），并引入误差边界感知时间步采样器和引导尺度调度器。

Result: THG将函数评估次数(NFE)减少高达30%，生成保真度损失极小(ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032)，在相同计算预算下优于最先进的CFG训练免费加速器。

Conclusion: 多速率公式为扩散求解器提供了新潜力，为无需模型重新训练即可实现实时高质量图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草图生成方法主要关注通用合成，缺乏对草图风格的精确控制机制。传统风格迁移方法会覆盖自注意力中的键值矩阵，导致内容泄漏问题。

Method: 提出免训练框架，将参考特征作为辅助信息结合线性平滑，采用风格-内容引导机制。通过联合AdaIN模块支持多参考草图的特征整合，实现可控多风格生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现高质量的草图生成，具有准确的风格对齐和更好的风格控制灵活性，尤其在参考草图与目标草图结构相似度低的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: M3S框架有效解决了草图风格控制中的内容泄漏问题，提升了合成质量，为精确的草图风格生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available
at https://github.com/CMACH508/M3S.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档理解中，确定扫描或拍摄文档的正确方向是一个关键的预处理步骤，因为错误的相机方向会导致OCR性能下降。需要开发有效的旋转校正方法来提升下游OCR任务的性能。

Result: 旋转分类方法在ORB-En和ORB-Indic数据集上分别达到96%和92%的准确率。在模拟真实世界设置中，该模块显著提升了闭源OCR模型（最高14%）和开源权重模型（最高4倍）的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的旋转分类方法在文档方向识别方面表现出色，能够有效提升OCR系统的性能，特别是在处理旋转文档时具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准来自不同模态的图像是支持生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用的关键步骤。本研究旨在研究颜色转换技术如何影响H&E染色图像与多模态图像的配准性能。

Method: 使用20个组织样本对，应用多种预处理步骤（包括CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane等颜色转换方法、反转、对比度调整、强度归一化和去噪），然后使用VALIS配准方法进行刚性配准和两步非刚性配准。

Result: 在原始和反转多模态图像的两种配准场景中，CycleGAN颜色转换都实现了最低的配准误差，而其他方法显示出更高的误差。

Conclusion: 在配准前应用颜色转换可以改善不同模态图像之间的对齐，支持数字病理学中更可靠的分析。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的自适应统计融合器（AStF），通过引入偏度和峰度两个高阶统计量来改进人体运动风格迁移，解决了传统方法仅依赖均值和方差的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值和方差的图像风格迁移方法在运动风格迁移中效果有限，因为运动数据具有复杂的动态模式和时空相干性，需要更全面的统计建模。

Method: 提出自适应统计融合器（AStF），包含风格解耦模块（SDM）和高阶多统计注意力机制（HOS-Attn），并结合运动一致性正则化（MCR）判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过更全面地建模动态风格中的时空统计模式，AStF在运动风格迁移方面表现出优于现有技术的熟练度优势。

Conclusion: 引入偏度和峰度等高阶统计量能够更有效地捕捉运动数据的复杂动态特性，提升运动风格迁移的质量和真实性。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Result: MedSapiens在平均成功检测率上比通用模型提升5.26%，比专业模型提升21.81%；在少样本设置下比现有最优方法提升2.69%。

Conclusion: 人类中心基础模型为解剖标志点检测提供了强大的先验知识，这一潜力此前未被充分挖掘。MedSapiens证明了这种适应策略的有效性。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中建模信号泄漏偏差能够实现可靠且可解释的AI图像和深度伪造取证。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模态不变的外观特征，但忽略了步态特征这种既模态不变又富含时间动态的特征，限制了跨模态视频匹配的时空一致性建模能力。

Method: 提出DinoGRL框架，包含SASGL模型生成增强轮廓表示，以及PBMGE模块通过步态和外观流的双向交互渐进优化多粒度特征表示。

Result: 在HITSZ-VCM和BUPT数据集上的大量实验证明该方法优越性，显著超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合DINOv2视觉先验学习步态特征，并与外观特征互补，能够实现鲁棒的跨模态视频行人重识别。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射加速方法未能有效调节高斯数量，导致冗余计算时间开销，需要解决训练时间与渲染质量之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出基于多视图一致性的致密化和剪枝策略，摒弃预算机制，充分考虑每个高斯基元的重要性。

Conclusion: FastGS展示了强大的通用性，能够在保持可比渲染质量的同时大幅加速3D高斯溅射训练过程。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared

TL;DR: 本研究将通用视觉基础模型适配到除草剂试验表征领域，通过自监督学习在农业数据集上训练，显著提升了物种识别和损伤分类性能，特别是在未见条件下表现更佳，并能大幅减少标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 除草剂田间试验需要准确识别植物物种和评估除草剂引起的损伤，但通用视觉基础模型在农业领域的细粒度区分方面性能有限，因此需要开发针对除草剂试验的领域专用模型。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法，在大型精选农业数据集上训练通用视觉基础模型，使其学习针对除草剂试验图像的丰富且可迁移的表征。

Result: 领域专用模型在物种识别（F1从0.91提升至0.94）和损伤分类（从0.26提升至0.33）上显著优于通用基础模型。在未见条件下提升更大（物种识别从0.56到0.66；损伤分类从0.17到0.27）。在无人机图像等域偏移场景中保持强性能（物种分类从0.49到0.60）。

Conclusion: 领域专用基础模型具有强大的泛化能力，能显著减少人工标注工作量，为除草剂试验分析提供可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过结合合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星影像训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，探索合成训练数据对提升海上基础设施检测性能的作用，并在未见区域验证模型的地理可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着海上基础设施的快速扩张，需要有效的监测系统，但现有模型在样本稀缺时表现不佳，特别是对于代表性不足的物体类别、形状和尺寸。

Method: 使用2023年第四季度从里海、南海、几内亚湾和巴西海岸获取的合成和真实Sentinel-1卫星影像训练YOLOv10目标检测模型，并在墨西哥湾、北海和波斯湾三个未见区域进行地理可迁移性评估。

Result: 模型共检测到3,529个海上平台（北海411个、墨西哥湾1,519个、波斯湾1,593个），F1分数达到0.85，加入合成数据后提升至0.90。

Conclusion: 合成数据能够增强不平衡类别的表示和整体模型性能，为实现全球可迁移的海上基础设施检测迈出重要一步，证明了深度学习在可扩展的全球海上基础设施监测中的潜力。

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: RISE-T2V是一个创新的文本到视频生成框架，通过集成提示词重述和语义特征提取，解决了现有模型在简洁提示词下视频质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器进行语义对齐，但在简洁提示词下难以保持视频质量，且无法在线重述提示词以更好地匹配用户意图。

Method: 提出RISE-T2V框架，集成提示词重述和语义特征提取为单一流程，引入重述适配器模块，利用LLM在预测下一个token时的文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件。

Result: RISE-T2V能够将基础提示词隐式重述为更全面的表示，显著提升文本到视频模型生成与用户意图对齐的高质量视频的能力。

Conclusion: RISE-T2V是一个通用的框架，适用于不同的视频扩散模型架构，显著增强了文本到视频模型的能力和可用性。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传感器遮挡对BEVFusion架构3D目标检测性能的影响，发现相机遮挡导致mAP下降41.3%，而LiDAR仅在重度遮挡时性能下降47.3%。融合设置中，LiDAR遮挡比相机遮挡影响更大，揭示了模型对LiDAR的更强依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然BEV融合架构通过多模态集成表现出强大性能，但由雾、霾或物理障碍等环境条件引起的传感器遮挡对3D检测精度的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构在nuScenes数据集上研究遮挡对相机和LiDAR输出的影响，使用mAP和NDS评估检测性能。

Result: 中等相机遮挡导致仅基于相机的检测mAP下降41.3%；LiDAR仅在重度遮挡时性能下降47.3%；融合设置中，相机遮挡仅导致4.1%下降，而LiDAR遮挡导致26.8%下降。

Conclusion: 模型对LiDAR的依赖更强，未来需要研究遮挡感知评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术，以在部分传感器失效或环境条件恶化时保持检测精度。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low?cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该工作通过减少现实场景中手动分析的需求，为野生头足类动物行为研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

Method: 提出STC-Net框架，通过定位、窗口提议和分级模块联合执行时间定位和分级。引入结合硬软定位目标和背景感知分级监督的新型损失函数，在弱时间监督下直接从完整视频中工作。

Result: 在1,859个LC视频的私有数据集上评估，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，在两项指标上均优于非定位基线超过10%。

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了从完整LC视频中进行基于PGS的自动手术复杂度评估的可扩展有效方法，有望用于术后分析和手术培训。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

TL;DR: UniSplat是一个用于自动驾驶的前馈3D重建框架，通过统一的潜在时空融合学习鲁棒的动态场景重建，解决了稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏、非重叠相机视图和复杂场景动态的联合挑战时表现不佳，需要一种能够有效整合空间视图和时间帧信息的鲁棒重建框架。

Method: 构建3D潜在支架捕获几何和语义场景上下文，引入高效融合机制在3D支架内直接操作实现时空对齐，设计双分支解码器结合点锚定细化和基于体素的生成来产生动态感知高斯，并维护静态高斯的持久内存以实现流式场景补全。

Conclusion: UniSplat通过统一的潜在时空融合框架，成功解决了自动驾驶中动态场景重建的关键挑战，实现了超越现有方法的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖的框架，通过同时处理视觉提示输入和长文本描述，解决了CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的局限性，在像素级交互和长文本处理方面取得了突破性成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面存在局限，特别是文本编码器的token长度限制阻碍了处理更细粒度文本信息的能力。现有方法主要关注增强视觉信息处理的粒度，而多模态大语言模型的研究表明长文本描述训练能有效改善细粒度对齐。

Method: 1) 建立自动化标注流水线生成像素级定位的长文本描述，构建包含近150万样本的LongGRIT数据集；2) 用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器；3) 提出三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，促进任意粒度下图像区域与对应文本描述的细粒度对齐。

Result: PixCLIP在像素级交互和长文本处理方面展示了突破性进展，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同利用增强视觉和文本内容处理粒度的优势，有效解决了CLIP在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的核心限制，为像素级视觉语言理解任务提供了有力工具。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化评估虚拟免疫组化染色图像质量的框架，通过颜色反卷积生成IHC阳性像素掩码，直接量化染色准确性而非图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于纹理和分布的图像质量评估指标只能量化图像保真度，无法准确评估IHC染色的准确性，需要一种更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用颜色反卷积生成真实和虚拟IHC图像的棕色染色像素掩码，计算Dice、IoU、Hausdorff距离等染色准确性指标，无需专家手动标注。

Result: 传统图像保真度指标（FID、PSNR、SSIM）与染色准确性和病理学家评估相关性差；配对模型（PyramidPix2Pix、AdaptiveNCE）染色准确性最高，非配对扩散和GAN模型可靠性较低；全玻片图像评估显示性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估虚拟IHC模型质量提供了可重复的方法，是加速病理学家常规使用的关键步骤。

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估模型，该模型无需参考视频且无需人工标注，通过利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化训练时域感知卷积架构，直接预测FR指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在局限性：全参考方法需要干净参考视频，大多数无参考模型依赖昂贵的人工标注，而大多数无监督无参考方法是基于图像的，忽略了视频对象检测的关键时域上下文。

Method: 利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化，训练时域感知卷积架构，直接从退化视频预测全参考指标（LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM），在推理时无需参考视频。

Result: 流式方法优于图像基线，能够泛化到各种退化类型，与全参考指标的相关性高于广泛使用的BRISQUE基线。

Conclusion: 时域建模对于现实世界视觉系统中可扩展的视频质量评估具有重要价值，提出的时域感知、无监督无参考方法有效。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在时空空间推理方面表现不佳，而获取具有精确空间标注的多样化真实视频数据存在瓶颈，因此需要开发系统化的模拟数据生成框架来缓解这一限制。

Method: 提出SIMS-V框架，利用3D模拟器的特权信息生成空间丰富的视频训练数据，通过系统消融实验分析问题类型、混合方式和规模对真实世界迁移效果的影响。

Result: 识别出三种最有效的问题类别，仅用25K模拟示例训练的7B参数模型在真实世界空间推理基准上超越72B基线，达到与专有模型竞争的性能，同时保持通用视频理解能力。

Conclusion: 模拟数据可以高效开发可迁移的空间智能，精心选择的问题类型比全面覆盖更有效，该方法在保持通用性能的同时显著提升了具身和真实世界空间任务的性能。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态智能系统主要关注反应式任务驱动方法，缺乏对空间认知和世界建模的深度理解，需要向更全面的超感知范式转变。

Method: 提出空间超感知的四阶段框架，开发VSI-SUPER基准测试（包括VSR和VSC任务），训练Cambrian-S模型，并引入基于预测误差的自监督下一潜在帧预测器方法。

Result: 通过VSI-590K数据训练，在VSI-Bench上获得+30%绝对性能提升，但在VSI-SUPER上表现仍有限。预测性感知方法显著优于领先的专有基线模型。

Conclusion: 仅靠规模扩展不足以实现空间超感知，需要能够预测、选择和组织经验的模型，预测性感知是未来发展的可行路径。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Conclusion: InfinityStar是第一个能够生成工业级720p视频的离散自回归视频生成器，为高效高质量视频生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,

Method: 提出了TubeletGraph系统，首先识别可能被忽略的轨迹，基于语义和邻近性先验决定是否整合这些轨迹，然后对添加的轨迹进行推理并生成描述每个观察到的转换的状态图。

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过提取大语言模型中的隐藏状态激活，基于大五人格特质构建低秩子空间，实现人格特质的精确控制和引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成内容时表现出隐含的人格特质，但如何可靠地控制或对齐这些特质以满足特定需求仍是一个开放挑战。需要有效的机制在生成过程中进行行为操控。

Method: 提出一个新颖的流程：从transformer层提取隐藏状态激活，应用大五人格特质框架，使用低秩子空间发现方法，识别跨不同模型架构的特质特定最优层进行稳健注入。

Result: 研究发现人格特质占据低秩共享子空间，这些潜在结构可以通过精心设计的扰动转化为有效的引导机制，而不会影响流畅性、方差和一般能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在心理学理论和实际模型对齐之间架起了桥梁，实现了对LLM输出中特质表达的精确控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

TL;DR: TextualVerifier是一个用于TextGrad的自我验证框架，通过思维链分解、变体生成、多数投票和共识聚合四阶段工作流程，使用大语言模型解决文本推理的有效性问题，显著提升了推理步骤的有效性和优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad作为文本自动微分方法缺乏自我验证机制，无法确保文本推理的有效性，这限制了其在复合AI系统中的可靠应用。

Method: 提出TextualVerifier验证框架，采用四阶段工作流程：思维链分解、变体生成、多数投票和共识聚合，并与TextGrad在损失函数和优化结果验证阶段进行非侵入式集成。

Result: 实验结果显示：在PRM800K上推理步骤有效性提升29%；与TextGrad集成后在GPQA-Diamond、MMLU-ML和MMLU-CP基准上分别获得8.08、10.71和3.92个百分点的改进；损失函数集成使性能从68.2%提升至70.4%，平均增加5.9次LLM调用。

Conclusion: TextualVerifier是首个基于LLM技术为TextGrad提供的自我验证框架，无需数值梯度即可实现更可靠的推理，为文本优化中的验证开辟了新方向。

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for

Abstract: We present an extended Greek Dialectal Dataset (GRDD+) 1that complements the
existing GRDD dataset with more data from Cretan, Cypriot, Pontic and Northern
Greek, while we add six new varieties: Greco-Corsican, Griko (Southern Italian
Greek), Maniot, Heptanesian, Tsakonian, and Katharevusa Greek. The result is a
dataset with total size 6,374,939 words and 10 varieties. This is the first
dataset with such variation and size to date. We conduct a number of
fine-tuning experiments to see the effect of good quality dialectal data on a

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARS是一种解码时算法，通过迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定大小的token片段来引导模型生成，显著提高计算效率和对齐质量，在六个LLM上表现优于SFT和DPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法如微调计算成本高且效果不理想，而推理时方法如Best-of-N采样需要不切实际的计算量才能达到最佳对齐效果。

Method: 提出STARS算法：在解码时迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定大小的短token片段，实现生成路径的早期修正。

Result: 在六个LLM上，STARS比监督微调(SFT)胜率提高达14.9个百分点，比直接偏好优化(DPO)提高达4.3个百分点，与强Best-of-N基线保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 细粒度、奖励引导的采样是传统微调和全序列排序方法的一种通用、鲁棒且高效的大语言模型对齐替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二分决策序列的高效多标签文本分类方法，通过将分类任务重新表述为一系列是/否决策，结合前缀缓存机制，在保持准确性的同时显著提升短文本推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多标签分类任务中的效率问题，特别是短文本推理场景下的性能瓶颈。

Method: 将多标签分类分解为独立的二分查询，结合前缀缓存机制，并使用LLM-to-SLM蒸馏方法，通过强大的标注模型生成多个标注来微调较小模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在零样本基线基础上显示出显著改进，特别是在训练期间见过的维度上表现更好。

Conclusion: 将多标签分类分解为二分查询，结合蒸馏和缓存感知推理，为基于LLM的分类提供了一个可扩展且有效的框架，该方法具有通用性，可应用于不同领域。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了三种低资源语言（阿法尔奥罗莫语、阿姆哈拉语和提格里尼亚语）机器翻译数据集的质量问题，重点关注性别代表性，发现数据集存在严重的性别偏见和有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低资源语言被纳入NLP研究，大规模数据集的收集往往重数量轻质量，这可能导致技术性能差和产生有害内容，因此需要调查这些数据集的质量问题。

Method: 通过分析三种低资源语言的机器翻译数据集，重点关注性别代表性，包括人名、动词的语法性别和刻板印象描绘等方面。

Result: 研究发现训练数据中政治和宗教领域文本占主导，而基准数据集集中在新闻、健康、体育领域；数据集存在严重的男性偏向，在数据量最大的语言中针对女性的有害和毒性描绘更为突出。

Conclusion: 数量不能保证质量，需要进一步调查低资源语言数据集并及早减轻有害内容。

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

TL;DR: GRAD是一种解码时方法，通过构建稀疏令牌转移图来缓解LLM幻觉问题，无需重新训练即可将生成过程基于语料库证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部知识源，但基于提示的接地方法脆弱且领域敏感，符号知识集成需要高昂的检索和格式化成本。

Method: GRAD通过单次前向传播在小型检索语料库上累积下一个令牌对数来构建稀疏令牌转移图，在解码时对图检索的对数进行最大归一化并与模型对数自适应融合。

Result: 在三个模型和多个问答基准测试中，GRAD始终优于基线方法，内在准确率提高9.7%，幻觉率降低8.6%，正确性提高6.9%，在所有方法中获得最高的真实性-信息性乘积分数。

Conclusion: GRAD提供了一种轻量级、即插即用的替代方案，证明来自语料库级令牌转移的统计证据可以有效引导生成更真实和可验证的输出。

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Motivation: 测试智能体在多轮语言环境中进行上下文敏感语用推理的能力，比较人类和视觉语言模型在迭代参考游戏中的表现差异。

Method: 使用迭代参考游戏实验，通过改变上下文的数量、顺序和相关性来测试人类和视觉语言模型的表现。

Result: 在没有相关上下文时，模型表现虽高于随机水平但远差于人类；在有相关上下文时，模型性能随试验次数显著提升；对于抽象指称物的少样本参考游戏，机器学习模型仍面临困难。

Conclusion: 迭代参考游戏是测试上下文敏感语用推理的重要基准，当前模型在相关上下文支持下能显著提升性能，但在抽象指称物的少样本任务中仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Motivation: 量化人类繁荣这一多维概念对于理解超越经济指标的社会福祉至关重要，现有测量方法缺乏精细的空间和时间分辨率。

Method: 使用微调的大型语言模型分析约26亿条地理位置标记的美国推文（2013-2023年），对48个与哈佛全球繁荣研究框架一致的指标进行分类，包括对移民态度和腐败认知。

Result: 数据集提供了县级和州级月度及年度繁荣相关话语指标，验证表明这些测量准确代表了基础构念，并与既定指标显示出预期的相关性。

Conclusion: 这一资源使得能够以前所未有的分辨率进行福祉、不平等和社会变革的多学科分析，提供了过去十年美国社交媒体话语中反映的人类繁荣动态的见解。

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at
unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human
flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States
over the past decade.

*Fu-Chun Yang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过向量翻译在多智能体系统中实现跨模型语义通信的方法，替代传统的token传递方式，减少计算开销并提升信息传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体设置中，语言模型通过token传递消息会丢弃大部分潜在语义，限制了信息传输并增加了不必要的计算开销。

Method: 使用双编码器翻译器在Llama-2-7B和Mistral-7B-Instruct模型之间学习映射，实现表示空间的直接语义交换，并以30%的混合强度注入翻译后的向量。

Result: 翻译器实现了0.538的平均余弦对齐度，双向评估显示2.01:1的传输不对称性，表明通用模型比指令调优变体产生更可转移的表示。

Conclusion: 这种保守的注入方法保持了计算稳定性，证明了跨模型潜在通信是可行的，使协作AI系统能够共享语义而非token。

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格推理基准测试主要使用小型、统一的表格，无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性，导致对LLMs推理能力的评估不完整。真实表格通常很长、异构且具有领域特异性，需要跨数千个标记的多跳推理。

Method: 引入RUST-BENCH基准测试，包含7966个问题，来自2031个真实世界表格，涵盖两个领域：RB-Science（NSF资助记录）和RB-Sports（NBA统计数据）。该基准测试联合评估LLMs在规模、异构性、领域特异性和推理复杂性方面的表现。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLMs在处理异构模式和复杂多跳推理方面存在困难，揭示了当前架构和提示策略的持续弱点。

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH为推进表格推理研究建立了一个具有挑战性的新测试平台，突显了当前LLMs在处理真实世界复杂表格推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）管道在检索证据不完整时经常失败，导致推理过程中存在空白。溯因推理作为一种生成合理缺失前提来解释观察结果的原则性方法，可以填补这些空白。

Method: 提出的框架包括三个步骤：检测证据不足、生成候选缺失前提、通过一致性和合理性检查验证这些前提。

Result: 在溯因推理和多跳问答基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法提高了答案准确性和推理可信度。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了溯因推理作为增强RAG系统鲁棒性和可解释性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在知识密集型领域（如手术、天文学、治疗）部署时，用户（通常是领域专家）不仅需要答案，还需要反映专家级推理的有意义解释。现有评估方案主要关注解释的合理性或内部忠实性，但未能衡量解释内容是否真正符合专家直觉。

Method: 与领域专家合作，开发了T-FIX基准，涵盖七个知识密集型领域，并设计了新的指标来测量LLM解释与专家判断的对齐程度。

Result: 提出了专家对齐作为评估解释的新标准，并建立了包含七个领域的T-FIX基准，开发了相应的评估指标。

Conclusion: 需要新的评估框架来确保LLM在知识密集型领域生成的解释能够真正与专家判断对齐，而不仅仅是表面上的合理性。

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分理解时间约束的复杂语义信息，而LLMs虽然具有强大的语义理解和推理泛化能力，但在时序推理方面存在局限性，容易产生幻觉和知识缺失。

Method: 提出PoK框架，包含知识规划模块将复杂时序问题分解为预定义工具的子目标序列，以及构建时序知识存储和对比检索框架，选择性检索语义和时间对齐的事实。

Result: 在四个基准TKGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoK显著提升了LLMs的检索精度和推理准确性，最多超越最先进TKGQA方法56.0%的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合结构化规划和时序知识检索，PoK有效增强了时序推理的可解释性和事实一致性，解决了LLMs在时序推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

TL;DR: 本文比较了人类与大型语言模型在情感词汇联想行为上的差异，发现LLMs与人类联想重叠度中等，但LLMs的联想倾向于放大情感负荷，且更可预测、缺乏创造性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类词汇联想能揭示心理词典内部结构，但人类联想受个人经验、情感和认知风格影响，难以预测。研究旨在探索LLMs是否以类似人类方式生成联想，特别是对情感词汇的联想。

Method: 通过比较人类参与者与大型语言模型对情感词汇的联想行为，分析两者在联想模式上的相似性和差异。

Result: 人类与LLMs的联想重叠度中等；LLMs的联想倾向于放大刺激词的情感负荷；LLMs的联想比人类更可预测且缺乏创造性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在词汇联想方面与人类存在显著差异，其联想行为更加可预测但缺乏人类特有的创造性联想能力。

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

TL;DR: 本研究通过大规模训练数据集扩展基于transformer的模型，在放射学报告的自动去标识化方面取得突破，性能优于商业云供应商系统，为安全临床文本处理建立了新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强放射学报告的自动去标识化能力，通过扩展训练数据集和基准测试来提升保护健康信息(PHI)检测性能，并与商业云供应商系统进行对比。

Method: 在现有最先进的基于transformer的PHI去标识化流程基础上，使用斯坦福大学两个大型注释放射学语料库进行微调，引入新的PHI类别(AGE)，并在斯坦福大学和宾夕法尼亚大学的测试集上评估性能。

Result: 模型在宾夕法尼亚大学数据集上获得0.973的总体F1分数，在斯坦福数据集上获得0.996的总体F1分数，优于或保持了先前最先进模型的性能。在合成PHI评估中表现稳定，总体F1为0.959，且在所有供应商系统中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 基于transformer的去标识化模型在多样化放射学数据集上训练后，在PHI检测方面优于先前的学术和商业系统，为安全临床文本处理建立了新基准。

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

TL;DR: 本文研究语言识别的k列表识别问题，给出了k列表识别的精确特征化，并建立了统计设置下的识别率界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的语言识别在极限情况下对于大多数有趣的语言集合是不可能的。受最近语言生成相关积极结果的启发，本文重新审视经典语言识别问题，赋予学习者每次输出k个猜测的能力。

Method: 基于Angluin特征化的递归版本，给出了语言集合k列表识别的精确特征化，并将其分解为k个可识别子集合。

Result: 证明了语言集合可k列表识别的充要条件是该集合可分解为k个可识别子集合，并建立了指数级识别率的最优性。

Conclusion: k列表识别提供了比经典识别更强的学习能力，且识别率在可识别情况下可达指数级，而在不可识别情况下无法达到任何趋于零的识别率。

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 批处理提示不仅降低了大型语言模型的推理成本，还作为一种推理时正则化器，通过抑制过度思考、减少犹豫语言和鼓励更果断的答案，显著提高推理准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索批处理在大型推理模型中的额外好处，超越其作为吞吐量优化的传统角色，研究其如何正则化模型行为。

Method: 在13个多样化基准测试上进行综合研究，通过详细的行为分析观察批处理对模型推理行为的影响。

Result: 批处理提高了准确性，同时大幅减少推理令牌使用（通常3-5倍），抑制过度思考，减少犹豫语言，并出现集体效应：模型从批次中较早示例泛化模式来解决更难的问题。

Conclusion: 批处理不仅是一种吞吐量优化技术，更是强大的推理时正则化器，能够实现更高效可靠的大型语言模型推理。

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: RIDE是一个基于项目反应理论的对抗性重写框架，通过强化学习生成难度可控的数学问题变体，用于评估LLMs的真实数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学推理任务上的高表现可能源于训练数据泄露或浅层模式匹配，而非真正的推理能力，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 使用35个LLMs模拟学生构建难度排序器，结合项目反应理论测量问题难度，通过强化学习指导问题重写模型生成不同难度的问题变体。

Result: 在竞赛级数学基准测试中，RIDE生成的扰动版本使先进LLMs性能平均下降21.73%，暴露了数学推理的有限鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDE框架有效评估了LLMs的真实数学推理能力，证实了其评估方法的有效性，并揭示了当前模型在数学推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CantoASR是一个结合ASR和大型音频语言模型的粤语语音识别纠错框架，通过强制对齐提取声学特征、LoRA微调Whisper提升音调识别，以及指令调优Qwen-Audio进行韵律感知纠错，在低资源粤语数据上显著降低了字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语作为低资源语言，存在标注数据有限、六种声调、变调和口音变化等挑战，现有ASR模型如Whisper在粤语识别中词错误率较高，需要结合声学线索和上下文推理来提升性能。

Method: 提出协作式ASR-LALM纠错框架：使用强制对齐提取声学特征，LoRA微调Whisper提升音调辨别能力，指令调优Qwen-Audio进行韵律感知的纠错。

Result: 在自发粤语数据上的评估显示，相比Whisper-Large-V3取得了显著的字符错误率提升。

Conclusion: 将声学线索与LALM推理相结合，为低资源声调语言和方言的ASR提供了可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

TL;DR: 本文探索了三种多智能体LLM管道用于Text-to-SQL任务，发现多智能体讨论可以提升小型模型的性能，其中LLM Reasoner-Coder管道效果最佳，能将准确率从52.4%提升至56.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在从自然语言生成SQL时面临模式规模大和复杂推理的挑战，先前工作多关注复杂不实用的旗舰模型管道，而小型高效模型被忽视。

Method: 提出三种多智能体LLM管道：(1)多智能体讨论管道，智能体迭代批判和精炼SQL查询，法官合成最终答案；(2)规划器-编码器管道，思考模型规划器生成逐步SQL生成计划，编码器合成查询；(3)编码器-聚合器管道，多个编码器独立生成SQL查询，推理智能体选择最佳查询。

Result: 在Bird-Bench Mini-Dev集上的实验显示，多智能体讨论可提升小型模型性能，Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct经过三轮讨论后执行准确率提升10.6%。LLM Reasoner-Coder管道效果最佳，DeepSeek-R1-32B和QwQ-32B规划器将Gemma 3 27B IT准确率从52.4%提升至最高的56.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM管道能有效提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能，特别是LLM Reasoner-Coder管道表现最优，为小型高效模型的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

TL;DR: LAAC提出将LLM作为智能通信中介的新范式，通过结构化对话捕捉发送者意图，促进真实知识交换，避免AI生成内容的膨胀-压缩循环。本文系统评估了LAAC在多个通信领域部署的可信度要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容泛滥导致通信剧场化，发送者用LLM将简单想法膨胀为冗长内容，接收者用LLM压缩回摘要，双方都不接触真实内容。需要改变这种低效通信模式。

Method: 通过控制实验评估LAAC多智能体架构的三个可信度维度：信息捕获保真度、可重现性和查询响应完整性，涵盖多个LAAC用例。

Result: 初步发现显示存在可测量的信任差距，在LAAC可靠部署到高风险通信场景前必须解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 虽然LAAC有潜力改变AI辅助通信模式，但在信息保真度、一致性和可靠性方面仍需解决关键信任问题才能在高风险场景中可靠部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个计算图灵测试框架来评估LLM生成文本的真实性，并系统比较了9个开源LLM在5种校准策略下的表现，发现即使经过校准，LLM输出仍与人类文本有明显区别，特别是在情感表达方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社会科学中广泛使用LLM模拟人类行为，但缺乏对LLM生成文本真实性的可靠验证方法，现有基于人类判断的评估方法不够准确。

Method: 引入计算图灵测试框架，结合聚合指标（BERT检测性和语义相似度）与可解释语言特征（风格标记和主题模式），系统比较9个开源LLM在5种校准策略下的表现。

Result: 即使经过校准，LLM输出仍明显可区分于人类文本，特别是在情感表达方面；指令调优模型表现不如基础模型；模型规模扩大不会增强人类相似度；存在人类相似度与语义保真度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了可扩展的验证和校准框架，同时警示当前LLM在捕捉人类交流方面存在局限性，优化人类相似度往往以牺牲语义保真度为代价。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

TL;DR: REMIND是一种新的机器学习遗忘评估方法，通过分析模型在输入微小变化时的损失模式来检测未学习数据的残余影响，比现有方法更敏感且实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘评估方法通常在单个输入层面进行评估，可能忽略语义相似示例中的残余影响，这会损害隐私并导致间接信息泄露。

Method: REMIND分析模型在输入微小变化时的损失模式，发现未学习数据产生更平坦、坡度较小的损失景观，而保留或无关数据则呈现更尖锐、波动性更强的模式。

Result: REMIND仅需要基于查询的访问，在相似约束条件下优于现有方法，在不同模型、数据集和转述输入中表现出鲁棒性，适合实际部署。

Conclusion: REMIND提供了一个更敏感和可解释的遗忘效果衡量标准，为语言模型中的遗忘评估提供了可靠框架，并对记忆和遗忘提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然研究人员致力于改进预训练数据集，但很少有人关注预训练机制从数据中提取知识和信息的效率。本文旨在量化预训练过程中遗漏的数据集价值。

Method: 采用检索增强生成和测试时计算的方法，从标准开源数据集中检索信息，并在测试时利用额外计算来解析检索到的上下文。

Result: 在MMLU、Math-500和SimpleQA等基准测试中，检索带来了显著的准确率提升，且这种提升在数据去污染后仍然存在。在MMLU上，检索相当于预训练计算量的5倍效果，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MMLU上获得了10个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: 当前的预训练方法未能充分利用现有预训练数据集中的信息，仍有显著的改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

### [78] [SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256)
*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SSPO方法，在GRPO和GSPO之间取得平衡，采用句子级别的重要性比率，避免训练崩溃和高方差问题，同时防止整个响应被裁剪机制丢弃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO存在策略更新不稳定问题，GSPO存在采样数据利用率低的问题，需要一种平衡的方法来改进这些问题。

Method: SSPO应用句子级别的重要性比率，并在PPO-CLIP中应用句子熵来稳定调整裁剪边界，鼓励高熵token探索并缩小低熵token的裁剪范围。

Result: SSPO在五个数据集上平均得分46.57，超越GRPO(43.01)和GSPO(44.42)，在三个数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SSPO通过结合GSPO的优点并克服其缺点，有效利用了生成数据，在强化学习验证奖励训练中表现出色。

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于微调机器翻译系统的数据选择方法，通过定义可学习性评分来评估数据点对训练的价值，并采用考虑数据点间相互依赖关系的批量选择策略，显著提高了数据效率和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据质量及其有效选择是提高机器翻译模型性能的基础，对于构建稳健可靠的翻译系统至关重要。现有方法在数据选择效率和训练效果方面存在改进空间。

Method: 利用学习器模型与预训练参考模型之间的协同作用，定义可学习性评分系统评估数据点的训练效用，并采用考虑数据点间相互依赖关系的批量选择策略。

Result: 在英译波斯语等多个语言对上的实验表明，该方法相比iid基线实现了高达5倍的数据效率提升，使用缓存嵌入时计算效率提高24%，并获得了优于随机选择方法的翻译性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据选择方法能够显著提高机器翻译微调的数据效率和计算效率，同时改善模型的泛化能力和翻译性能。

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在时间推理方面的能力，特别是当要求模型以特定历史时期（1940年）的视角回答问题时，以及语言选择对性能的影响。

Method: 使用1940年挪威书籍中的琐事问题，在英语和挪威语中提示LLMs回答问题，采用LLM-as-judge评分方法，并由母语者进行抽样检查。

Result: 英语提示始终比挪威语获得更好的结果，这是一个意外发现；使用更大的LLMs能改善结果；测试了DeepSeek-R1、Gemma3、Qwen3和Llama3.1模型系列，以及专门为挪威语设计的最大可用LLM。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间推理方面表现出一定能力，但语言选择对性能有显著影响，英语提示优于挪威语提示，模型规模对结果有积极影响。

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

TL;DR: PTTSD是一个概率性文本时间序列抑郁症检测框架，通过临床访谈的逐句文本预测PHQ-8抑郁评分，同时建模时间不确定性。该框架在E-DAIC和DAIC-WOZ数据集上取得了文本系统的SOTA性能，并提供良好校准的预测区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的抑郁症严重程度预测模型往往缺乏不确定性估计和时间建模能力，而准确的、可解释的预测对于临床决策支持至关重要。

Method: PTTSD包含序列到序列和序列到单一变体，结合双向LSTM、自注意力机制和残差连接，使用高斯或Student-t输出头通过负对数似然进行训练。

Result: 在E-DAIC数据集上MAE为3.85，在DAIC数据集上MAE为3.55，达到文本系统的SOTA性能，并产生良好校准的预测区间。消融实验证实了注意力和概率建模的价值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过三部分校准分析和定性案例研究，突出了不确定性感知预测的可解释性和临床相关性，为抑郁症检测提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高资源语言，泰语在需要文档结构理解的任务中代表性不足，需要专门的评估框架。

Method: 构建了多样化、人工标注的数据集，在零样本设置下评估了包括专有和开源系统在内的多种最先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现优于开源模型，特别是在细粒度文本识别和手写内容提取任务中开源模型性能下降最明显。

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench为低资源、复杂脚本环境下的视觉语言模型评估提供了标准化框架，并为改进泰语文档理解提供了可行见解。

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人类中心应用中的重要性增加，理解其类似人格的行为对于负责任的发展和部署变得日益重要。

Method: 应用Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2)框架，在不同采样温度下评估六个LLM的人格特质表达，并使用层次聚类分析模型特征。

Result: 发现四个主要人格维度存在显著差异，神经质和外向性对温度调整敏感，层次聚类揭示了不同的模型集群，表明架构特征可能影响稳定人格特征的形成。

Conclusion: 这些结果为LLM中类似人格模式的出现提供了新见解，并为模型调优、选择和AI系统伦理治理提供了新视角。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

*Paloma Rabaey,Jong Hak Moon,Jung-Oh Lee,Min Gwan Kim,Hangyul Yoon,Thomas Demeester,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两部分的框架来处理放射学报告中的不确定性，包括显性不确定性（通过犹豫短语表达）和隐性不确定性（由于推理过程被省略而产生）。通过创建专家验证的LLM参考排名和扩展框架，生成了Lunguage++基准，支持不确定性感知的图像分类和诊断推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告对临床决策至关重要，但包含不确定性，这阻碍了自动化分析。显性不确定性通过犹豫短语表达，其含义随上下文变化；隐性不确定性源于放射科医生省略部分推理过程，导致无法确定未提及的发现是否真正缺失。

Method: 1. 量化显性不确定性：创建专家验证的LLM参考排名，将常见犹豫短语映射到概率值；2. 建模隐性不确定性：通过扩展框架，基于专家定义的14种常见诊断路径，系统性地添加特征性子发现。

Result: 发布了Lunguage++，这是Lunguage细粒度结构化放射学报告基准的扩展、不确定性感知版本。该资源支持不确定性感知的图像分类、忠实的诊断推理，并促进对诊断不确定性临床影响的新研究。

Conclusion: 提出的两框架方法成功处理了放射学报告中的显性和隐性不确定性，为不确定性感知的医学图像分析和诊断推理提供了有价值的工具和基准。

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

TL;DR: 该研究探索语言模型在生成文本时是否隐含表示可能的推理路径，通过控制隐藏激活来预测模型的不确定性，发现激活干预在模型尚未确定最终答案时最有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成文本时，单个token的选择可能导致完全不同的推理路径，这使得不确定性难以量化。研究旨在验证语言模型是否表示它们可能采取的替代路径。

Method: 使用隐藏激活来控制并预测语言模型在思维链推理过程中的不确定性，通过激活干预实验来测试模型的可操控性。

Result: 发现模型在不同token上的不确定性与通过控制激活来引导模型的容易程度存在明显相关性；隐藏激活可以预测模型的未来结果分布。

Conclusion: 语言模型隐式表示可能的路径空间，激活干预在模型尚未承诺特定最终答案时最为有效。

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural

leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有G-SEO方法仅限于基于文本的优化，无法充分利用多模态数据。随着多模态检索增强生成技术的发展，生成搜索引擎能够整合文本、图像、音频和视频，但现有的优化方法未能跟上这一发展。

Method: 提出Caption Injection方法，从图像中提取标题并注入到文本内容中，整合视觉语义来增强内容在生成搜索中的主观可见性。在MRAMG基准上系统评估该方法在单模态和多模态设置下的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，在G-Eval指标下，Caption Injection显著优于仅基于文本的G-SEO基线方法，证明了多模态整合在G-SEO中提高用户感知内容可见性的必要性和有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态整合对于生成搜索引擎优化至关重要，Caption Injection方法通过有效利用视觉语义显著提升了内容在生成搜索中的可见性，为多模态G-SEO研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Generative Search Engines (GSEs) leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multi-source
information and provide users with accurate and comprehensive responses. Unlike
traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift
users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective
perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context,
enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine
Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the
rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG)
techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video,
producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs.
Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and
fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption
Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from
images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to
enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We
systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under
both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption
Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval
metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration
in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.

Result: 在两个下游任务上的实验显示，precision@5指标提升了最高12.1%。

Conclusion: E-CARE方法能够高效利用LLMs的常识推理能力，显著提升电商推荐性能，同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Finding relevant products given a user query plays a pivotal role in an
e-commerce platform, as it can spark shopping behaviors and result in revenue
gains. The challenge lies in accurately predicting the correlation between
queries and products. Recently, mining the cross-features between queries and
products based on the commonsense reasoning capacity of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has shown promising performance. However, such methods suffer from high
costs due to intensive real-time LLM inference during serving, as well as human
annotations and potential Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). To boost efficiency
while leveraging the commonsense reasoning capacity of LLMs for various
e-commerce tasks, we propose the Efficient Commonsense-Augmented Recommendation
Enhancer (E-CARE). During inference, models augmented with E-CARE can access
commonsense reasoning with only a single LLM forward pass per query by
utilizing a commonsense reasoning factor graph that encodes most of the
reasoning schema from powerful LLMs. The experiments on 2 downstream tasks show
an improvement of up to 12.1% on precision@5.

Method: 采用数据摄取管道处理CSV文件和大学网页信息，结合BM25词汇排名和ChromaDB语义检索的混合方法，使用LLaMA-3.3-70B生成对话响应。

Result: 生成文本语义相关性高，BERTScore为0.831，METEOR得分为0.809；数据管道更新效率高，更新耗时106.82秒，新数据处理耗时368.62秒。

Conclusion: 该聊天机器人能够帮助学生解答疑问，更好地理解大学生活，并在开放学分制大学中协助规划学期日程。

Abstract: University students face immense challenges during their undergraduate lives,
often being deprived of personalized on-demand guidance that mentors fail to
provide at scale. Digital tools exist, but there is a serious lack of
customized coaching for newcomers. This paper presents an AI-powered chatbot
that will serve as a mentor for the students of BRAC University. The main
component is a data ingestion pipeline that efficiently processes and updates
information from diverse sources, such as CSV files and university webpages.
The chatbot retrieves information through a hybrid approach, combining BM25
lexical ranking with ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and uses a Large Language
Model, LLaMA-3.3-70B, to generate conversational responses. The generated text
was found to be semantically highly relevant, with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a
METEOR score of 0.809. The data pipeline was also very efficient, taking 106.82
seconds for updates, compared to 368.62 seconds for new data. This chatbot will
be able to help students by responding to their queries, helping them to get a
better understanding of university life, and assisting them to plan better
routines for their semester in the open-credit university.

### [92] [Coordination-Free Lane Partitioning for Convergent ANN Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04221)
*Carl Kugblenu,Petri Vuorimaa*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无协调的通道分区方法，将向量搜索中的重复计算转化为互补工作，在不增加成本或延迟的情况下显著提高召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量搜索系统通常通过并行通道（线程、副本或分片）来满足延迟SLO，但这些通道会重复发现相同候选，额外计算无法增加覆盖范围。

Method: 为每个查询：(1)构建确定性候选池，大小为总top-k预算；(2)应用每查询伪随机排列；(3)为每个通道分配不相交的位置切片。通道无需运行时协调即可返回不同结果。

Result: 在4个通道、总候选预算64的情况下，SIFT1M数据集上recall@10从0.249提升到0.999，通道重叠从近100%降至0%；MS MARCO数据集上hit@10从0.200提升到0.601，MRR@10从0.133提升到0.330。

Conclusion: 提出简单操作指南：将每查询池大小设为总预算，在通道间确定性分区位置，在不改变预算或截止时间的情况下将冗余扇出转化为互补覆盖。

Abstract: Production vector search systems often fan out each query across parallel
lanes (threads, replicas, or shards) to meet latency service-level objectives
(SLOs). In practice, these lanes rediscover the same candidates, so extra
compute does not increase coverage. We present a coordination-free lane
partitioner that turns duplication into complementary work at the same cost and
deadline. For each query we (1) build a deterministic candidate pool sized to
the total top-k budget, (2) apply a per-query pseudorandom permutation, and (3)
assign each lane a disjoint slice of positions. Lanes then return different
results by construction, with no runtime coordination.
  At equal cost with four lanes (total candidate budget 64), on SIFT1M (1M SIFT
feature vectors) with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW)
recall@10 rises from 0.249 to 0.999 while lane overlap falls from nearly 100%
to 0%. On MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with HNSW, hit@10 improves from 0.200 to
0.601 and Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) from 0.133 to 0.330. For inverted
file (IVF) indexes we see smaller but consistent gains (for example, +11% on MS
MARCO) by de-duplicating list routing. A microbenchmark shows planner overhead
of ~37 microseconds per query (mean at the main setting) with linear growth in
the number of merged candidates.
  These results yield a simple operational guideline: size the per-query pool
to the total budget, deterministically partition positions across lanes, and
turn redundant fan-out into complementary coverage without changing budget or
deadline.

*Zefeng Li,Ning Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出DRCSD模型解决推荐系统中用户-物品交互矩阵噪声问题，通过解耦协作信号和按阶去噪来提升推荐性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CF算法因交互矩阵中的噪声导致推荐性能不佳，现有去噪方法多在单一图上进行，可能削弱协作信号

Method: DRCSD包含协作信号解耦模块（按结构特征分解信号为不同阶次）和按阶去噪模块（对各阶进行针对性去噪），并修改传统GNN聚合机制避免跨阶信号干扰

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，DRCSD对不稳定交互具有优越鲁棒性，在推荐准确率指标上相比最先进基线模型获得显著性能提升

Conclusion: DRCSD通过解耦协作信号和按阶去噪有效解决了传统去噪方法削弱协作信号的问题，显著提升了推荐系统的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Although the collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm has achieved remarkable
performance in recommendation systems, it suffers from suboptimal
recommendation performance due to noise in the user-item interaction matrix.
Numerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most
existing approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause
attenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can
interrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative
information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel
GNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD
includes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes
signals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise
denoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the
information aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is
modified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling
operation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that
DRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves
statistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.

investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models
of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates. We conduct an
empirical study involving several LLMs on three tasks spanning different
datasets. Our results reveal relationships between task performance and
properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas
for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 本文研究了汇编代码分析中的分词问题，评估了NLP分词模型的内在特性及其对下游任务的影响，发现分词选择显著影响性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汇编代码分析中的分词问题研究不足，但分词对词汇表大小、语义覆盖和下游任务性能等内在特性有重要影响，需要系统评估。

Method: 通过内在评估比较不同分词器的效率，使用Llama 3.2、BERT和BART等预训练模型，分析分词器在汇编指令编码和语义捕捉方面的表现。

Result: 初步发现表明分词器选择显著影响下游性能，内在指标只能部分预测外在评估结果，揭示了内在分词特性与实际任务效用之间的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: 本研究为低级代码分析中的分词模型优化提供了宝贵见解，有助于提升基于自然语言模型的二进制分析工作流程的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型中文本和图像表示用户行为数据的有效性差异，以最大化模型性能。

Method: 开发BehaviorLens基准框架，在六个MLLMs上测试三种数据表示方式：文本段落、散点图和流程图，使用真实购买序列数据集。

Result: 图像表示相比等效文本表示，MLLMs的下次购买预测准确率提高了87.5%，且无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: 图像表示在用户行为推理中比文本表示更有效，能显著提升多模态大语言模型的预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了深度知识追踪(DKT)模型的主流解释，证明其优势在于建模先决条件关系的因果结构而非双向关系，通过图剪枝和因果子集训练验证了DKT的预测能力与因果结构强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战深度知识追踪(DKT)模型的主流解释，即其性能提升源于建模知识组件(KC)间的双向关系，提出DKT的真正优势在于建模先决条件关系的因果结构。

Method: 通过将练习关系图剪枝为有向无环图(DAG)，在Assistments数据集的因果子集上训练DKT，并使用DKT学习到的表示提取练习关系DAG的替代方法。

Result: 实验表明DKT的预测能力与因果结构强相关，其学习到的表示能有效提取练习关系DAG，支持DKT有效性主要源于近似KC间因果依赖关系的观点。

Conclusion: DKT的有效性主要由其建模知识组件间因果依赖关系的能力驱动，而非简单的双向关系映射，这为理解深度知识追踪模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在文化价值观方面的表现，发现提示语言和文化框架都会影响模型输出，但无法克服模型对荷兰、德国、美国和日本等少数国家价值观的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在全球范围内被广泛使用，用户使用多种语言与之互动，但训练数据和优化目标存在不平衡，引发了对LLMs是否能代表其广泛用户群文化多样性的质疑。

Method: 使用来自霍夫斯泰德价值观调查模块和世界价值观调查的63个项目，翻译成11种语言，以带有和不带明确文化视角的提示形式探测10个LLMs。

Result: 提示语言和文化视角都会导致LLM输出变化，但所有测试模型都表现出相似模式：在大多数话题上产生相当中立的回应，在社会容忍度等议题上采取选择性进步立场。明确文化视角比针对性提示语言更能改善与人类受访者文化价值观的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs处于一个尴尬的中间地带：它们对提示变化足够敏感以产生变化，但又过于固守特定文化默认值而无法充分代表文化多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

Motivation: 多智能体AI系统基于大语言模型，具有固有的非确定性，容易发生漂移、循环和输出细节缺失等静默故障，这些故障难以检测。

Method: 提出了一个数据集构建流程，捕捉用户行为、智能体非确定性和LLM变化，并创建了两个基准数据集。使用监督学习（XGBoost）和半监督学习（SVDD）方法进行异常检测基准测试。

Result: 监督学习方法（XGBoost）准确率达到98%，半监督学习方法（SVDD）准确率达到96%。两种方法在异常检测任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: 这是对多智能体AI系统中异常检测的首次系统性研究，提供了数据集、基准测试和见解，为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型在数值推理中的内部表示机制，发现模型会编码真实世界的数值相关性但会系统性放大它们，无关的数值上下文会引发表示偏移，且下游影响随模型规模变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行为研究已记录了大语言模型在数值推理中的错误，但其底层表示机制仍不清楚。研究者假设数值属性占据共享的潜在子空间，并探究模型如何整合单个实体的多个数值属性，以及无关数值上下文如何干扰这些表示和下游输出。

Method: 结合线性探测与偏相关分析，以及基于提示的脆弱性测试，在不同规模的模型上进行实验。

Result: 结果显示，大语言模型编码了真实世界的数值相关性但倾向于系统性放大它们。无关上下文会在幅度表示中引发一致的偏移，下游影响随模型规模而变化。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLM决策中的一个脆弱性，为在多属性纠缠下实现更公平、表示感知的控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentmandering框架，将选区重划重新构想为两个代表对立政治利益的智能体之间的回合制谈判，通过LLM智能体将战略互动嵌入到选区重划过程中，显著减少了党派偏见和不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算方法主要生成大量合法选区重划方案，但忽视了选择过程中的战略动态，这为党派行为者挑选技术上合规但政治上有利的地图创造了机会。仅仅满足形式约束并不能确保公平性。

Method: 采用基于游戏理论的Choose-and-Freeze协议，两个LLM智能体轮流从少量候选地图中选择和冻结选区，通过受约束且可解释的选择逐步划分州。

Result: 在2020年美国人口普查数据上的评估显示，Agentmandering显著减少了党派偏见和不公平性，同时实现了比标准基线低2到3个数量级的方差，在摇摆州场景中表现出公平性和稳定性。

Conclusion: Agentmandering框架通过将战略互动嵌入选区重划过程，能够有效减少党派偏见，提高公平性和稳定性，特别是在关键的政治竞争场景中。

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: LLM-KGFR框架通过将大语言模型与知识图谱基础检索器结合，解决了LLM在知识密集型问题上的局限性，实现了对未见知识图谱的零样本泛化和大规模图谱的高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理方面表现出色，但在处理知识密集型问题时受到上下文限制和参数知识的限制。现有方法依赖微调的LLM或GNN检索器，存在数据集特定调优和在大型或未见图谱上可扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 提出LLM-KGFR协作框架，其中LLM与结构化检索器KGFR协同工作。KGFR使用LLM生成的关系描述编码关系，并根据实体在问题中的角色初始化实体。采用非对称渐进传播(APP)方法逐步扩展，选择性限制高度节点同时保留信息路径。通过节点、边和路径级接口，LLM迭代请求候选答案、支持事实和推理路径。

Result: 实验表明LLM-KGFR在保持可扩展性和泛化能力的同时实现了强大的性能。

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR为知识图谱增强推理提供了一个实用的解决方案，在可扩展性、泛化性和性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework为工作流质量评估和优化提供了数学基础，支持自动化系统的工作流管理和改进。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂社会表示如何从统一的预测驱动中涌现提供了理论原则和生物学基础，实现了社会集体智能。

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLoop是一个自改进框架，通过迭代策略初始化解决RLVR中的过拟合问题，将训练过程转化为探索和利用的良性循环，显著提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在可验证奖励训练中的过拟合问题，即模型获得训练奖励但失去泛化能力，这由策略过度专业化和训练期间产生的多样化解决方案的灾难性遗忘驱动。

Method: 引入RLoop框架，基于迭代策略初始化：首先使用RL从给定策略探索解空间，然后过滤成功轨迹创建专家数据集，通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)来优化初始策略，为下一次迭代创建更好的起点。

Result: RLoop有效缓解遗忘并显著改善泛化，相比原始RL平均准确率提升9%，pass@32提升超过15%。

Conclusion: RLoop通过将瞬态策略变化转化为稳健性能增益，成功解决了RL训练中的过拟合和泛化问题。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出在可解释AI中，仅凭概念激活向量(CAV)探针的分类准确性不足以可靠衡量概念对齐度，因为探针可能捕捉虚假相关性而非真正概念。作者提出了基于空间线性归因的新概念定位方法，并引入了三类量化评估概念对齐的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CAV方法中，高探针准确率被错误地等同于概念对齐度，但实际上探针更可能捕捉虚假相关性而非真正概念，这严重影响了可解释AI的可信度。

Method: 引入基于空间线性归因的新概念定位方法，与现有特征可视化技术进行对比分析；提出三类概念对齐评估指标：硬准确率、分割分数和增强鲁棒性；构建故意错位的探针来验证问题。

Result: 研究表明，故意错位的探针利用虚假相关性也能达到接近标准探针的准确率；具有平移不变性和空间对齐的探针能持续提高概念对齐度。

Conclusion: 需要基于对齐度的评估指标而非探针准确率，探针设计应考虑模型架构和目标概念特性，空间对齐和翻译不变性是关键因素。

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

TL;DR: AdversariaLLM是一个用于LLM越狱鲁棒性研究的工具箱，旨在解决当前LLM安全研究生态系统中的碎片化、可复现性和可比性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全和鲁棒性研究生态系统存在碎片化、实现错误等问题，导致研究难以复现和比较，阻碍了有意义的进展。

Method: 设计了一个以可复现性、正确性和可扩展性为中心的工具箱，实现了12种对抗攻击算法，集成了7个基准数据集，提供对Hugging Face上各种开源LLM的访问，并包含计算资源跟踪、确定性结果和分布评估等高级功能。

Conclusion: 该工具箱为LLM安全研究提供了稳健的基础，促进了该领域的透明性、可比性和可复现性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

*Jiahao Zhao,Luxin Xu,Minghuan Tan,Lichao Zhang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了RxSafeBench框架，通过模拟临床咨询来评估大语言模型在药物安全方面的能力，构建了包含6725条禁忌症、28781种药物相互作用和14906个适应症-药物对的RxRisk DB数据库，并在2443个高质量咨询场景中测试发现当前LLMs在整合禁忌症和相互作用知识方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实世界数据集以及隐私和可访问性问题，针对大语言模型在医疗系统中药物安全性的研究有限，且在实际临床咨询环境中的评估尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一个模拟和评估临床咨询的框架，生成包含药物风险的问诊对话，构建专门的药物安全数据库RxRisk DB，采用两阶段过滤策略确保临床真实性和专业质量，创建RxSafeBench基准，使用结构化多选题评估LLMs在模拟患者情境下推荐安全药物的能力。

Result: 结果显示当前的大语言模型在整合禁忌症和相互作用知识方面存在困难，特别是当风险是隐含而非明确时。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了在基于LLM的系统中确保药物安全性的关键挑战，并提供了通过更好的提示和任务特定调优来提高可靠性的见解。RxSafeBench为评估LLMs中的药物安全性提供了第一个综合基准，推动了更安全、更可信的AI驱动临床决策支持。

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV)框架，通过在Generate-Verify范式前添加显式监控机制来解决模型在推理过程中过早陷入次优路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时推理架构缺少监控过程，导致模型容易陷入前缀主导陷阱，造成约20%的准确率损失。

Method: 将Flavell以及Nelson和Narens的元认知理论形式化为计算规范，在生成前添加显式监控机制来捕获元认知体验，并通过验证反馈来优化未来监控。

Result: 虽然未提供实证验证，但这是首次系统性地将基础元认知理论转化为计算框架。

Conclusion: MGV框架为理解推理系统失败提供了原则性词汇，并为未来测试时推理设计提供了具体的架构干预建议。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

### [110] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO是一种新的强化学习优化方法，解决了GRPO在序数奖励下对失败轨迹错误强化的问题，通过自适应基线确保失败解不被正强化，并在达到质量阈值后转向相对偏好模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO的简单性使其在序数奖励下存在缺陷，会对失败轨迹分配正优势值并强化错误行为，需要改进以支持更丰富的非二元反馈。

Method: CoRPO使用自适应基线强制执行最低质量阈值，确保失败解决方案永远不会被正强化。当策略持续满足阈值后，基线自动过渡到相对偏好模式。

Result: 在代码验证任务上实证验证，CoRPO表现出更稳定的收敛性和更好的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是在LLM通过强化学习学习真正新能力研究计划中的关键一步，通过从二元奖励扩展到序数奖励，为更密集的逐步监督奠定了基础。

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

TL;DR: 本文开发了博弈论实验的数字孪生系统，通过系统化提示和探测框架评估LLMs的行为表现。研究发现Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式，而Qwen更接近纳什均衡预测，无需人物设定提示即可实现群体行为复制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs与人类决策的相似性至关重要，因为不匹配可能导致实际应用中的有害结果，而无法复制人类行为则使LLMs在社会模拟中无效。

Method: 开发博弈论实验的数字孪生，引入系统化提示和探测框架，测试三个开源模型（Llama、Mistral和Qwen），并在原始人类测试游戏之外生成新的游戏配置假设。

Result: Llama能高保真复制人类合作模式并捕捉人类偏离理性选择理论的行为，Qwen与纳什均衡预测高度一致。无需人物设定提示即可实现群体行为复制。

Conclusion: 适当校准的LLMs可以复制聚合人类行为模式，并系统探索未开发的实验空间，为社会和行为科学研究提供补充方法，生成关于人类社交决策的新实证预测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出将自然语言查询中的歧义性重新定义为合作交互的特征，开发了一个区分可解析合作查询与不可解析非合作查询的框架，并分析了15个流行数据集中的查询类型混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言表格数据接口需要处理查询中的固有歧义性，作者认为不应将歧义视为缺陷，而应将其视为合作交互的特征，用户和系统共同承担查询规范的责任。

Method: 开发了一个原则性框架来区分合作查询（可解析解释）和非合作查询（无法解析），并将该框架应用于15个流行表格问答和分析数据集的查询分析。

Result: 分析发现这些数据集中的查询类型存在不受控制的混合，既不适合评估系统的执行准确性，也不适合评估解释能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和分析将视角从修复歧义转向在解析查询中拥抱合作，为表格数据自然语言接口的设计和评估提供了更明智的基础，并概述了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

Motivation: 在公民大会等审议过程中，参与者只能向专家提出有限数量的问题，如何选择最具代表性的问题集是一个重要挑战。本文旨在解决这个问题，确保所有参与者的利益都能得到充分代表。

Method: 引入基于合理代表制(JR)的审计框架，开发了在通用效用设置下审计JR的首个算法，最有效算法的时间复杂度为O(mn log n)。应用该方法分析历史审议数据，比较不同问题选择方法的代表性。

Result: 开发了高效的JR审计算法，应用于历史审议数据分析。结果表明LLM在支持审议过程中既有前景也存在当前局限性。将方法集成到已在50多个国家使用的在线审议平台中。

Conclusion: 通过提出的审计框架和算法，能够有效评估和改进审议过程中问题选择的代表性，为实践者提供了实用的工具来确保更公平的审议过程。

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合作多智能体规划中由于部分信息和有限通信导致的轨迹级协调失败问题，小的时间或运动偏差会级联成冲突。

Method: 采用两阶段协商协议：首先提出候选角色并推理，然后在共识和环境约束下承诺联合分配；承诺后每个智能体独立生成和执行其角色的符号规划，不透露详细轨迹。

Result: 在合作推块任务实验中，智能体能够跨情景适应，动态世界模型捕获可重用模式，提高了任务完成率和效率。

Conclusion: 通过符号规划而非原始轨迹推理，DR.WELL避免了脆弱的步骤级对齐，实现了可重用、可同步和可解释的高层操作，以时间开销换取演化出更高效的合作策略。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

TL;DR: VeriCoT是一个神经符号方法，通过将思维链推理形式化为一阶逻辑并使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性，解决LLMs无法可靠验证自身逻辑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然能通过思维链进行多步推理，但无法可靠验证自身逻辑，即使在得出正确答案时，底层推理也可能存在缺陷，这在高风险场景中会削弱信任。

Method: VeriCoT从思维链推理中提取形式化逻辑论证，将每个推理步骤形式化为一阶逻辑，识别基于源上下文、常识知识或先前推理步骤的前提，使用自动求解器验证逻辑有效性。

Result: 在ProofWriter、LegalBench和BioASQ数据集上的实验表明，VeriCoT能有效识别有缺陷的推理，并作为最终答案正确性的强预测指标。利用验证信号进行推理时自我反思、监督微调和偏好微调，进一步提高了推理有效性和准确性。

Conclusion: VeriCoT通过神经符号方法为LLMs推理提供了可靠的验证机制，增强了推理的可信度，并通过验证信号驱动的微调策略进一步提升了推理质量。

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.
