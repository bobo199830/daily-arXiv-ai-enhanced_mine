### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练时提供干扰因素的快捷路径，防止目标属性与干扰因素纠缠，提高生成质量和文本提示遵从性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器训练方法容易将目标属性（如身份）与干扰因素（如姿势、表情、光照）纠缠在一起，限制了泛化能力和文本提示遵从性。

Method: 在适配器训练期间，通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为干扰因素提供快捷路径，消除适配器学习这些因素的动机，然后在推理时移除辅助模块。

Result: 应用于面部和全身身份注入任务时，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵从性。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解耦表示的最有效路径可能是为不应该学习的内容建立快捷路径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 是一种新的视频生成范式，通过将参考视频作为语义提示，引导冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer进行上下文生成，解决了语义控制视频生成的通用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法要么通过基于结构的控制引入伪影，要么依赖于不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构，缺乏统一、可泛化的语义控制能力。

Method: VAP采用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过即插即用的Mixture-of-Transformers专家引导冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer，并使用时序偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验，实现鲁棒的上下文检索。

Result: VAP在开源方法中达到最先进水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美，并展示了强大的零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持。

Conclusion: VAP在实现通用可控视频生成方面取得了显著进展，其统一模型架构和强大的泛化能力为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度，同时在可见点跟踪上保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前判别式模型在点跟踪中只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉不确定性下的多模态轨迹，特别是在视觉遮挡情况下。

Method: 采用生成式框架，结合流匹配公式、迭代精炼、窗口相关先验和点坐标专用方差调度，在推理时使用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进水平，同时保持可见点跟踪的竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升遮挡点跟踪性能，为点跟踪任务提供了生成式解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [4] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含494k个高质量的五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以对解剖区域进行定位并以逐步方式推理，这与临床医生的实际诊断工作流程不匹配。现有3D数据集提供定位标签，但都不支持这种"基础推理"能力。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、定位相关解剖结构的3D边界框、临床医生生成的明确详细3D推理过程的诊断推理步骤，以及相关解剖区域的结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，用于评估定位和诊断准确性，并基准测试了五个最先进的视觉语言模型，为ReasonKnee-Bench提供了基准性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐、局部化决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

### [5] [Thermal Polarimetric Multi-view Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20972)
*Takahiro Kushida,Kenichiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法不受光照和材料特性影响，通过长波红外偏振成像避免了可见光偏振分析的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D形状重建中受光照和材料特性限制，无法有效处理透明、半透明和异质物体，需要一种不受这些因素影响的新方法。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，使用长波红外偏振成像，通过多视角热偏振图像恢复详细3D形状。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材料特性的有效方法，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [6] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的无监督自适应方法，通过多视角物体中心视频对视觉基础模型进行自监督微调，无需标注即可适应新领域，在分布偏移和标签稀缺场景下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标签稀缺的领域中表现不佳，而传统的监督微调在这些场景下不可行。虽然自监督学习在生成式语言模型中有效，但在视觉编码器模型中尚未证明有效。

Method: 提出VESSA方法，基于自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调。关键是通过精心调整预测头和应用参数高效自适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的综合实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前自适应方法均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: VESSA通过多视角物体观察有效学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性，无需标注即可成功适应新领域，为视觉基础模型的无监督自适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

### [7] [BioDet: Boosting Industrial Object Detection with Image Preprocessing Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21000)
*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化插件式流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度且推理开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在复杂工业环境下（如杂乱、光照差、复杂背景）性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要提升检测可靠性。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，采用低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的基础模型引导的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的误报。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在工业环境中提升未见物体检测的有效性和实用性，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [8] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用深度学习方法来检测地震后混凝土建筑和桥梁中暴露的钢筋，通过YOLOv11模型识别裂缝、剥落和钢筋暴露，并开发了一个混合框架来自动评估结构损伤等级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要。暴露钢筋的数量和分布是结构损伤和退化的指标，需要自动化检测方法。

Method: 基于深度学习框架，采用微调、数据增强和公开数据集测试。开发自动分类框架识别建筑物内外和结构构件，训练YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋，微调另一个YOLO模型区分不同结构损伤等级。

Result: 创建了一个混合框架，能够从输入图像中自动可靠地确定损伤等级。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过利用图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤背景下实现灾后快速自动化的损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

### [9] [ZING-3D: Zero-shot Incremental 3D Scene Graphs via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21069)
*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视角设置，不支持增量更新，缺乏3D空间中的显式几何接地，这些对于具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间。节点表示具有特征、3D位置和语义上下文的开放词汇对象，边捕获带有对象间距离的空间和语义关系。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了丰富的语义场景表示。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念和视觉语言模型的框架，用于先天性巨结肠症中神经丛分类，通过多模态学习提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要结合临床专业知识来提高模型的临床相关性。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（来自医学教科书和论文），通过大型语言模型生成提示并编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 提出的模型在各项分类指标上优于基于CNN的模型（VGG-19、ResNet-18、ResNet-50），准确率达到83.9%，精确率86.6%，特异性87.6%。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可以产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，用于快速低光照图像增强，在保持良好视觉效果的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Retinex的低光照图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要开发更高效的算法。

Method: 1. 定义直方图位置矩阵和直方图计数矩阵，建立光照、反射率和低光照图像直方图之间的关系；2. 基于先验信息和直方图Retinex模型构建两级优化模型；3. 通过求解优化模型得到光照直方图和反射率直方图的迭代公式；4. 通过直方图匹配增强低光照图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上均优于现有增强方法，在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒执行时间，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: HistRetinex模型成功将Retinex扩展到直方图域，实现了高效的低光照图像增强，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，将视觉推理扩展到部分可观察的交互环境中，要求智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察、基于视觉反馈动态调整决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要研究静态、完全可观察环境下的视觉推理，而现实世界信息往往因遮挡或视野限制而不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够主动获取信息的智能体。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注，用于训练智能体在更高阶马尔可夫决策过程中进行迭代推理。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA、RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath、Geometry30K)上达到最先进性能。分析发现当前具身MLLMs在主动获取和整合信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是视觉推理的重要扩展，现有模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要开发能够主动交互获取信息的智能体。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过生成仅安全相关特征不同的对比图像对来系统研究图像安全性，构建了包含3020对图像的新安全基准，用于评估和训练视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集标注粗糙模糊，无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征，难以系统区分良性图像和问题图像。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，仅改变与安全政策相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs框架为研究细粒度图像安全区分提供了首个系统性资源，既能评估模型弱点，又能提升防护模型的训练效果。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NoisyGRPO框架，通过向视觉输入注入可控噪声增强探索，并使用贝叶斯框架建模优势估计过程，提升多模态大语言模型的推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用思维链推理时难以超越训练分布的泛化，需要解决泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 采用噪声注入探索策略（高斯噪声扰动视觉输入）和贝叶斯优势估计（将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，融合噪声先验和轨迹奖励似然）。

Result: 在标准思维链质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提升了泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模多模态大语言模型上表现突出。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性多模态强化学习框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的推理泛化能力，尤其在资源受限的小规模模型上具有重要价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，以减少对碘对比剂的依赖和相关风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTPA依赖碘对比剂，存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。需要开发无对比剂的替代方法。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA。研究使用了410对CTPA和NCCT扫描，其中249对用于训练和验证，161对用于测试。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71, SSIM: 0.98；测试集MAE: 165.12, PSNR: 20.27, SSIM: 0.98），在下游任务中肺动脉和静脉分割的Dice、clDice和clRecall分别为0.70、0.71、0.73和0.70、0.72、0.75，血管体积的ICC从0.70提升到0.81。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效增强血管结构，特别是在小血管方面，为无对比剂肺血管疾病诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

*Guanlin Wu,Boyan Su,Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Yichen Lin,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了空间智能网格(SIG)来改进基础模型中的视觉空间智能评估，通过网格化结构编码物体布局和空间关系，并发布了包含1400个驾驶帧的SIGBench基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中视觉空间智能的评估主要依赖文本提示和VQA式评分，这种方法掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，且难以归因于真正的空间技能。

Method: 引入空间智能网格(SIG)作为结构化、基于网格的模式，明确编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理基础先验，作为文本的补充通道提供场景结构的忠实组合表示。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比仅使用VQA表示在所有VSI指标上都产生了更大、更稳定和更全面的增益，表明其作为学习VSI的数据标注和训练模式的潜力。

Conclusion: SIG提供了一个有前景的框架来量化和改进基础模型中的视觉空间智能，通过分离空间能力与语言先验，为自动驾驶等场景中的空间智能任务提供了更好的评估和训练方法。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

*Qihang Zhou,Binbin Gao,Guansong Pang,Xin Wang,Jiming Chen,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个针对异常检测的token-wise适配框架，通过动态对齐视觉和可学习文本空间来实现细粒度异常学习，相比现有方法在多个数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种不加区分的对齐阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 提出TokenCLIP框架，将token-agnostic文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态分配每个token到语义相关的子空间组合，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态token-wise对齐机制，有效解决了现有方法在异常检测中对多样化异常语义捕捉不足的问题。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议。

Method: 使用图表示VQA样本，通过知识增强基准演化(KBE)框架，整合多模态知识将静态基准转化为可控动态版本，支持视觉信息重选和外部文本知识扩展。

Result: 实验表明KBE有效缓解数据污染和饱和风险，提供更全面的MLLM能力评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态且难度可控的评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新型3D网格生成方法，通过并行生成和解耦训练策略，能够生成高质量的艺术风格3D网格，支持高达10,000个面和1024^3的空间分辨率。

Motivation: 实现高精度的令牌预测并支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过让模型同时"看到"所有网格令牌来提升效率和可控性。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略成功实现了高质量3D网格的生成，在效率和保真度方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

<details>

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但在视觉语言导航中缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在缩小仿真与现实差距方面的应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D方法，包含两个组件：(1) 对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注；(2) 物理感知执行连接，将碰撞对象嵌入3DGS并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，并引入首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench，包含2M VLN数据。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但具有强泛化性，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上将基线性能提升31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为可执行的语义和物理对齐环境，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中处理微小物体的局限性，通过强化学习实现了更好的分割和推理性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的多模态对齐组件可解释性不足，难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集合中。

Method: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，使用基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定的解码器，通过余弦相似度显式对齐多模态表示，确保语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过概念级别的对齐增强了视觉语言表示的可解释性和性能，为理解多模态对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态语义感知相关建模跟踪框架，通过动态语义相关性生成器增强搜索区域从模板中提取重要信息的能力，提高了在无人机跟踪挑战下的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪方法主要强调速度而缺乏语义感知探索，这阻碍了搜索区域从模板中提取准确的定位信息，导致在相机运动、快速运动和低分辨率等典型挑战下性能不佳。

Method: 提出动态语义感知相关建模跟踪框架，核心是动态语义相关性生成器，结合Transformer的相关图探索语义相关性，并设计了剪枝方法来提高跟踪速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强语义感知能力有效提高了无人机跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，同时通过模型变体实现了灵活部署。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅在训练时使用眼动注视的VLM增强框架，通过注视正则化注意力机制提升自我中心理解任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动注视能提供关于注意力、短期意图和未来行动的有价值线索，是建模自我中心行为的强大信号

Method: 使用注视正则化注意力机制，将模型关注点与人类视觉注视对齐，仅在训练时使用注视信号，设计灵活模块化

Result: 相比无注视正则化的基线模型，未来事件预测的语义预测分数提升达11%，当前活动理解提升约7%

Conclusion: 注视引导训练能显著提高自我中心VLM的准确性和鲁棒性，为在辅助机器人和人机协作等现实场景中增强VLM预测能力奠定了基础

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

### [29] [Why Registration Quality Matters: Enhancing sCT Synthesis with IMPACT-Based Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21358)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合像素级L1损失和基于SAM与TotalSegmentator的感知损失IMPACT-Synth。通过比较两种配准策略发现，基于IMPACT的配准能获得更准确的解剖对齐，但训练数据与评估管道一致的Elastix配准在验证集上得分更高，揭示了配准偏差对监督学习的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更鲁棒和可泛化的模型，减少对特定配准策略的依赖。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练解剖区域并进行区域微调。损失函数结合L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。采用AdamW优化器，基于补丁的归一化输入，测试时使用数据增强和五折集成。评估了Elastix和IMPACT两种配准策略。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了更准确和解剖一致的配准，降低了MAE并生成更真实的解剖结构。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据的模型得分更高，反映了与评估管道一致的配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估，可能以牺牲解剖保真度为代价来提升性能指标。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致的配准有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更鲁棒和可泛化的合成CT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的深度一致性约束无缝图像拼接方法能有效解决视差引起的对齐问题，在保持最优性能的同时显著提高算法效率。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

Motivation: 现有方法局限于预定义的少数概念轴（如颜色、形状），且主要在合成数据集中探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的视觉概念。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关概念轴，通过通用概念编码器自适应绑定视觉特征到发现的概念轴，优化组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法中表现优异，为处理真实世界多样化视觉概念提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构。本文旨在解决这一问题，提高LUT实现CNN方法的性能。

Method: 首先引入广义中值池化方法，然后扩展这一思想，通过学习每个方向的数据依赖池化系数，自适应地权衡不同方向像素块的贡献。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试上的实验结果表明，各向异性池化策略在感知和数值上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查找表的图像恢复CNN方法的性能，特别是在处理各向异性信号结构时表现更优。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后半部分控制不足。需要解决这些限制，提升修复质量。

Method: 将视频修复解耦为多帧一致的图像修复和掩码区域运动传播两个子任务；引入间隔帧先验；设计CoSpliced模块实现首帧传播策略；开发上下文控制器模块编码连贯先验并注入I2V生成主干。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在各种视频修复场景中实现了有竞争力的性能，显著改善了前景对齐和运动稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过创新的解耦方法和模块设计，有效解决了视频修复中的时空一致性问题，在多个指标上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

Method: 训练基于transcoder的稀疏自编码器，在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上分解医学图像表示，通过100个transcoder集成从MIMIC-CXR数据集的多模态嵌入中发现约5000个单语义模式。

Result: 发现了涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别的5000个单语义模式，每个模式在共享特定放射学特征的图像中表现出一致的激活行为，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式，在五个关键发现上达到竞争性诊断准确率。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明了医疗AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过从特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，确保发现的模式与临床决策直接相关，支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

TL;DR: 提出一种双流架构，通过整合宏观组织特征和细胞级表示来改进病理图像分析，特别针对癌症亚型分类等细粒度任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理基础模型虽然能捕捉全局组织上下文，但缺乏细胞级特征建模，这限制了在细粒度任务（如癌症亚型分类）上的性能。

Method: 采用双流架构，包含接受度加权的键值聚合模型（线性复杂度的循环transformer）来高效聚合大细胞集信息，以及双向组织-细胞交互模块来实现局部细胞线索与周围组织环境的相互关注。

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，该方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Result: 在封闭区域模型记录和公开真实数据集上的测试表明，该方法在高度拥挤空间中的表现优于无位置数据的方法。

Conclusion: GRAP-MOT在拥挤多摄像头场景中表现出色，同时分析发现IDF1比MOTA更适合MOT算法比较，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

TL;DR: 提出GranViT视觉Transformer，通过区域级自回归训练实现细粒度特征提取与LLM语义对齐，在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器专注于全局图像表示但忽视细粒度区域分析，由于缺乏细粒度标注数据和预训练范式，在细粒度感知方面存在局限。

Method: 构建Gran-29M数据集（200万图像+1.8亿区域级标注），采用预训练-适应框架和自蒸馏机制，通过边界框到标题回归增强视觉表示，标题到边界框回归改善LLM视觉特征利用。

Result: GranViT超越现有视觉编码器，在不同LLM上表现出强迁移性，在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解任务上取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: GranViT通过大规模细粒度预训练和区域级自回归训练，有效提升了视觉编码器的细粒度感知能力，在多模态任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，并引入前瞻引导(FSG)方法来解决现有CFG方法在效率和性能上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器自由引导(CFG)方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择，需要统一的视角来理解和改进其操作机制。

Method: 将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，寻找黄金路径使潜在变量在条件和无条件生成下产生一致输出。提出FSG方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并开启了自适应设计的潜力，FSG方法在理论和实践上都表现出优越性。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的跨注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型性能的同时，以更少的可训练参数实现视频音频同步。

Method: 连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在文本跨注意力后插入紧凑的视频跨注意力层，视频token经过池化以减少内存需求。

Result: 在视频音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现竞争力，参数量远少于现有多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和模块化特性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、模块化的视频到Foley生成方案，相同的桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态如语音生成。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO是一种基于块级优化的方法，用于解决GRPO在文本到图像生成中的两个关键限制：不准确的优势归因和忽略生成的时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出强大潜力，但面临两个关键限制：不准确的优势归因和忽略生成的时间动态。

Method: 将优化范式从步骤级转移到块级，将连续步骤分组为连贯的'块'以捕捉流匹配的内在时间动态，并在块级优化策略。还引入了可选的加权采样策略以进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面均取得了优异的结果。

Conclusion: Chunk-GRPO突出了块级优化对于基于GRPO的方法的潜力。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专门为夜间无人机跟踪设计的多尺度自适应系统，通过三个核心模块解决夜间跟踪的主要技术挑战：多尺度层次混合增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息，夜间模板校准器确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪在真实机器人操作中面临重大挑战，低光照条件限制视觉感知能力，杂乱背景和频繁视角变化导致现有跟踪器漂移或失效。现有基于低光增强和域自适应的方法在实际无人机系统中存在明显不足：低光增强常引入视觉伪影，域自适应方法计算昂贵，现有轻量设计难以充分利用动态目标信息。

Method: 提出MATrack系统，包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次混合（MHB）增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性；自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息；夜间模板校准器（NTC）确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。在实际无人机平台上的进一步测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为关键机器人应用（如夜间搜救和边境巡逻）提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段的超分辨率框架，采用"先文本后图像"范式，通过解耦字形恢复和图像增强来解决生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像和文本可读性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段框架：首先重建精确的文本结构，然后使用这些结构指导后续的全图像超分辨率，实现字形到图像的引导。

Result: 在包含极端缩放（×14.29）的首个场景文本数据集UltraZoom-ST上的广泛实验表明，TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时增强了可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过"先文本后图像"的范式成功打破了图像质量和文本可读性之间的权衡，实现了高保真度和视觉一致性。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

Motivation: 耐药性癫痫的术前评估需要定位癫痫灶，MEG中的发作间期癫痫样放电是重要生物标志物，但手动检测既繁琐又易出错，现有自动化方法不适合临床应用。

Method: 提出基于特征的ANN和CNN两种模型架构，在59名患者数据上训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量，并与现有最优模型进行比较。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上的表现均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式机器学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂且标注不完美的数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法为快速数据标注提供了潜力，所提模型是自动检测发作间期癫痫样放电的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过大规模合成数据生成和模糊感知架构来显著提升显著目标检测泛化能力的方法，创建了包含13.9万张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，在跨数据集泛化中实现了20-50%的错误率降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测面临数据限制问题，昂贵的像素级标注导致相关子任务需要分别训练模型，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道从扩散和DINO-v3特征中提取标签，创建大规模合成数据集S3OD；提出流线型多掩码解码器，通过预测多个有效解释来处理显著目标检测中的固有模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现了20-50%的错误率降低；经过微调的版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据生成和模糊感知架构能够显著提升显著目标检测的泛化能力，为数据受限任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑两种策略解决资源受限场景下的过自信和性能下降问题，在少量数据和计算资源下实现竞争性检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态对齐模型（如CLIP）在大规模预训练下表现良好，但在资源受限、数据质量差的情况下容易产生过自信和性能下降问题，特别是面对模糊或弱相关的图像-文本对时。

Method: 提出Modest-Align框架，包含两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入受控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（在嵌入空间中校准相似度分布），共同降低过自信并提升对噪声或弱对齐样本的处理能力。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就能达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界中低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管视频生成模型通过大潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术取得了显著进展，但仍然存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，破坏了真实3D场景的错觉。3D一致的视频生成对生成和重建任务的下游应用具有重要影响。

Method: 通过基于偏好的优化使用成对极线几何约束来对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法高效地强制执行几何原理，无需端到端可微分性。在静态场景和动态相机上进行训练以确保高质量测量，同时模型能有效泛化到多样化的动态内容。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，后者会产生噪声目标从而损害对齐质量。该方法在保持视觉质量的同时生成了空间一致的视频。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，在不影响视觉质量的前提下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

*Ziqi Gao,Qiufu Li,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAP-MAE是一种域自适应点云掩码自编码器预训练方法，通过异构域适配器和域特征生成器，自适应整合跨域数据集知识，解决点云数据稀缺问题，在多个点云分析任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同领域的点云数据规模有限，现有方法将混合域数据用于MAE预训练时，学到的先验知识与下游任务不匹配，导致性能下降。需要一种能自适应整合跨域知识的方法。

Method: 提出DAP-MAE，包含异构域适配器（预训练时使用适应模式，微调时使用融合模式）和域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效解决点云数据稀缺问题，通过自适应整合跨域知识，在多种点云分析任务中实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gompertz-CNN动态知识蒸馏框架，通过Gompertz增长模型动态调整蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配，在CIFAR数据集上相比传统方法提升准确率最高达8%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演变过程，导致知识迁移效果不佳

Method: 基于Gompertz曲线的阶段感知蒸馏策略，动态调整蒸馏损失权重；使用Wasserstein距离度量特征级差异，梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为；多损失目标统一框架

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet50和MobileNet_v2等架构，相比传统蒸馏方法分别获得最高8%和4%的准确率提升

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过模拟学生模型学习进程的动态特性，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合稀疏可穿戴IMU和UWB测距的新方法Group Inertial Poser，用于多人全身运动跟踪，解决了纯IMU方法在全局位置估计和相对定位方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯IMU跟踪方法存在全局位置估计不准确和多人相对定位困难的问题，因为惯性测量本质上是自参考的，无法提供他人空间参考。

Method: 利用稀疏可穿戴传感器之间的距离（包括个体内部和跨个体），通过UWB测距估计绝对距离，结合惯性观测输入到结构化状态空间模型中，集成时间运动模式进行精确3D姿态估计。采用新颖的两步优化方法利用估计距离准确跟踪全局轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据评估中，Group Inertial Poser在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于先前最先进方法，展示了IMU+UWB在野外多人运动捕捉的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合IMU和UWB技术，实现了更准确和鲁棒的多人全身运动跟踪，为野外多人运动捕捉提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对北美相机陷阱图像数据集的长尾分布问题，系统研究了长尾识别方法在物种识别中的应用，通过优化损失函数和正则化策略，在NACTI数据集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，并在域转移测试中表现出更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北美相机陷阱图像数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大的'Head'类别占数据集的50%以上。为了解决这种长尾分布对物种识别性能的影响，需要专门的长尾识别方法。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究各种长尾识别损失函数和LTR敏感正则化方法，包括实验优化调度器选择和最先进的LTR损失函数。

Result: 在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，相比标准交叉熵的95.51%基线有显著提升。在域转移测试中，优化后的长尾增强模型在ENA-Detection数据集上达到52.55%的准确率。

Conclusion: LTR增强方法在野生动物识别领域能带来一致性的性能提升，特别是在与最先进的LTR损失函数结合使用时。但LTR方法仍无法充分解决某些问题，包括在严重域转移下对'Tail'类别的灾难性性能下降。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于邻近突触相似性的无监督突触分类方法，无需预先知道突触类型数量，为果蝇数据提供了一种原理性的ground-truth选择方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统突触分类需要监督学习，需要提供不同类别的示例。本研究旨在开发一种仅基于邻近突触相似性的无监督分类方法，避免对先验知识的依赖。

Method: 利用同一神经元中邻近突触比随机选择的跨细胞突触更相似的观察，构建无监督分类算法，不预设突触类型数量。

Result: 成功将果蝇数据中的突触分为不同类别，验证了邻近突触相似性假设的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需预先知道突触类型数量的无监督分类方案，为突触结构的ground-truth选择提供了原理性方法。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，本研究旨在评估基础模型在WSI分类中的性能。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入，通过平均聚合策略聚合成玻片级特征，训练逻辑回归、梯度提升树和随机森林等机器学习分类器，并探索数据增强和图像归一化技术。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归模型使用Virchow2特征达到90%的最高准确率，但差异无统计学意义。平均聚合方法提供了可靠的玻片级特征表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化WSI分类中具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为玻片级表示学习的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个分层框架，用于生成无限扩展的3D场景，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验进行结构化场景块生成，解决现有方法在几何一致性、可扩展性和场景级生成方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在跨视图的几何和外观不一致性，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型主要面向对象而非场景级生成。需要开发能够生成无限扩展、几何一致且外观真实的3D世界的方法。

Method: 提出WorldGrow分层框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)数据整理流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；(2)3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3)从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在大型3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，同时独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: WorldGrow展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并为构建未来世界模型提供了潜力，实现了无限扩展、几何一致且外观真实的3D场景生成。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在生成多个视频时难以保持角色和背景一致性的问题，现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只关注角色一致性而忽略背景一致性。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，发现其能在去噪过程中提取前景掩码和识别匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明BachVid能够在无需额外训练的情况下实现生成视频的鲁棒一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖且高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致性视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型在解决长期存在的几何问题中的潜力，将几何推理重新构建为图像生成任务。

Method: 将每个几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准的视觉扩散模型，将高斯噪声转换为表示有效近似解的图像，模型学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置。

Result: 模型能够生成与精确解密切匹配的有效近似解，成功应用于三个著名的困难几何问题。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作为解决困难几何问题提供了一个通用实用的框架，为处理更广泛类别的挑战性几何任务打开了大门。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少量样本引导学习，使标准指令微调语言模型无需额外训练就能达到或超越专门推理模型的性能，同时在多个任务上实现更高的token效率和更丰富的推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型虽然成功，但需要大量计算资源和数据训练，运行成本高且速度慢。本研究旨在探索标准指令微调语言模型是否能够在不进行微调的情况下达到类似或更好的推理能力。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，结合CodeAct框架（语言模型在自然语言推理中交替执行代码）和少量样本引导学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现强推理能力。

Result: 在四个匹配的语言模型和推理模型对中，CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均表现优于相应推理模型（最高提升22.9%），token效率提高10-81%，在六个任务上四个模型平均表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt风格的学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础扎实且强大的系统，可能为权重内强化学习提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系方面的表现，揭示了三个关键限制：时代敏感性、浅层推理和上下文依赖的推理失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够捕捉现实、高风险任务的长上下文基准测试，以评估大语言模型对长法律文档的理解能力，因为现有评估大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法代表真实世界文档理解的复杂性。

Method: 使用236对案例的数据集，评估最先进的大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系方面的表现。

Result: 评估揭示了三个关键限制：(1) 时代敏感性——模型在历史案例上的表现比现代案例差，揭示了训练中的基本时间偏见；(2) 浅层推理——模型依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解；(3) 上下文依赖的推理失败——在复杂开放式任务中，模型产生时间上不可能的关系，尽管在简单上下文中保持基本的时间意识。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个基准，解决了现实长上下文评估中的关键差距，提供了一个反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large

knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [65] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了置信度门控的思维链（CoT）技术，通过训练无关的置信度估计方法来判断何时需要CoT推理，以减少不必要的推理过程并降低token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链（CoT）提示虽然能提升大语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力，但通常会增加大量token使用，且在某些任务中可能无效甚至有害。需要一种方法来自动判断何时应该使用CoT。

Method: 提出置信度门控CoT方法，当模型对直接答案置信度低时才调用推理。评估了四种训练无关的置信度估计方法，并与随机基线和完全知道何时需要CoT的oracle进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，现有的训练无关置信度测量方法能够减少冗余CoT使用，并优于随机调用CoT。但不同置信度测量的有效性不一致，随数据集和模型变化。

Conclusion: 当前置信度门控CoT方法具有潜力但存在局限性，不同置信度测量的效果不稳定，需要进一步研究以实现更可靠的自适应CoT门控。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

*Giovanni Trappolini,Florin Cuconasu,Simone Filice,Yoelle Maarek,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出UDCG指标，针对RAG系统中LLM处理检索结果的特点，改进了传统IR指标，通过考虑相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提升了与端到端答案准确性的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序浏览文档的假设，不适用于RAG系统中LLM整体处理检索结果的情况，且未考虑干扰文档对生成质量的负面影响。

Method: 提出基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，并设计LLM导向的位置折扣机制，开发UDCG指标。

Result: 在5个数据集和6个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标相关性提升高达36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件性能。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了在低误报率要求下的推理增强分类任务，发现在精度敏感场景中，推理增强反而表现不佳，而无推理模式在低误报率下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理已成为大语言模型的核心范式，但其在精度敏感任务中的适用性尚不明确，需要系统研究推理在严格低误报率要求下的表现。

Method: 研究涵盖安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务，在微调和零样本设置下评估标准LLM和大型推理模型，比较推理增强和无推理两种模式的表现。

Result: 推理增强提高整体准确率但在低误报率阈值下表现不佳；无推理模式在精度敏感场景中表现更好；基于token的评分优于自我表达置信度；两种模式的简单集成能结合各自优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但通常不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态选择编辑效用最高的演示样本，解决了传统上下文知识编辑中的数量-质量权衡和任务难度适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在事实回忆方面表现出色，但仍会传播过时或错误的知识。现有的上下文知识编辑方法依赖静态演示集，存在数量-质量权衡和缺乏任务难度适应性的问题。

Method: 提出DR-IKE框架：(1) 使用REINFORCE训练BERT检索器，根据编辑奖励对演示样本进行排序；(2) 采用可学习阈值修剪低价值样本，根据任务难度动态调整提示长度。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提升高达17.1%，延迟减少41.6%，同时保持对不相关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了无需修改模型权重、仅依赖前向传播的可扩展和自适应知识编辑能力，适用于黑盒LLM API。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前先进的问答系统主要针对英语，本研究旨在弥补语言差距，将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语这一低资源语言。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，集成问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略；使用机器翻译作为数据增强方法来解决印尼语数据集有限的问题。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了低资源语言问答系统的潜力和挑战，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能药物推荐对提高临床决策质量至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集，特别是非英语数据集，阻碍了此类系统的发展。

Method: 构建了包含5,894条去标识化记录的中文药物推荐数据集CDrugRed，涵盖患者人口统计信息、病史、临床过程和出院诊断，并基于该数据集对多个最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然监督微调能提高模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1分数为0.5648，Jaccard分数为0.4477。

Conclusion: 临床药物推荐任务具有复杂性，CDrugRed数据集为开发更稳健准确的药物推荐系统提供了具有挑战性和价值的资源。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型对数策略比率的奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，提升语言模型的泛化性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)作为离策略方法，在有限数据场景下容易过拟合且泛化能力差。需要解决SFT在数据稀缺情况下的泛化问题，同时避免依赖人工偏好标注。

Method: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法：1) 设计奖励函数为SFT模型与预训练基础模型的对数策略比率；2) 将预训练策略作为基线，SFT策略作为目标；3) 结合PPO进行在线策略微调；4) 无需人工偏好标注。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，特别是在高质量标注数据稀缺的场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO通过自奖励机制与PPO的结合，有效解决了SFT的局限性，在提升泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性方面具有显著优势，为使用演示数据对齐大语言模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

TL;DR: 提出VeriGray基准，通过引入Out-Dependent类别解决摘要忠实性评估中的标注模糊问题，发现即使是SOTA LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM摘要忠实性基准存在标注模糊问题，主要由于外部知识允许使用的边界不明确，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实性标注框架，引入中间类别Out-Dependent来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中存在约6%的幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成显著挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊性对于不忠实检测基准至关重要，现有方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Conclusion: 论文为语言和图学习的交叉领域提供了系统指导，指出了开放挑战和未来研究方向，旨在推动这一新兴领域的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析大语言模型在社会模拟中行为的系统框架，发现LLMs无法真实复现人类行为，而是反映了过度理想化的版本，表现出社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，导致形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性的"乌托邦"社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的人类行为模拟对于解释、预测和干预社会至关重要。虽然LLMs在模拟人类行为方面显示出潜力，但它们在社交情境中与真实人类行为的偏离程度仍未被充分探索，这可能在科学研究中导致误解，在实际应用中产生意外后果。

Method: 引入了一个系统框架，通过聊天室风格的对话模拟多智能体互动，并在五个语言维度上进行分析，提供了一种简单而有效的方法来检查涌现的社会认知偏见。对三个家族的八个代表性LLM进行了广泛实验。

Result: 研究发现LLMs无法忠实地复现真实的人类行为，而是反映了过度理想化的版本，受到社会期望偏见的影响。具体表现为社会角色偏见、首因效应和积极性偏见，导致形成缺乏真实人类互动复杂性和变异性的"乌托邦"社会。

Conclusion: 这些发现呼吁开发更具社会基础性的LLMs，以捕捉人类社会行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced

### [78] [Correlation Dimension of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21258)
*Xin Du,Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入相关维度这一分形几何度量来衡量语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，揭示了传统评估指标忽略的长程结构复杂性，并展示了该指标在检测模型退化、幻觉倾向等方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言生成方面取得显著进展，但仍表现出重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为，即使困惑度较低。这凸显了传统评估指标的局限性，即强调局部预测准确性而忽略长程结构复杂性。

Method: 引入相关维度作为分形几何度量，量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性。该方法捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中桥接局部和全局属性。

Result: 相关维度揭示了预训练中的三个不同阶段，反映了上下文依赖的复杂性，指示了模型的幻觉倾向，并可靠地检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。该方法计算效率高，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于多种自回归架构。

Conclusion: 相关维度为LLMs的生成动态提供了新的见解，是一个计算高效且广泛适用的文本复杂性度量工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

*Xinghao Wang,Pengyu Wang,Dong Zhang,Chenkun Tan,Shaojun Zhou,Zhaoxiang Liu,Shiguo Lian,Fangxu Liu,Kai Song,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn)方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来增加块级稀疏性，提高LLM预填充的计算效率，在长上下文任务中达到2.75倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要由于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有块稀疏注意力方法在块级稀疏性上存在不足。

Method: 提出PBS-Attn方法，将序列划分为块并利用注意力的置换特性来增加块级稀疏性，跳过部分块的计算，同时开发了自定义的permuted-FlashAttention内核。

Result: 在真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确性上持续优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近全注意力基线，在长上下文预填充中实现端到端2.75倍加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的高效注意力机制，通过增强块级稀疏性显著提高了长上下文LLM预填充的计算效率，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

### [80] [Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310)
*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似性惩罚来减少语义冗余输出，提高不确定性估计的样本效率，无需访问基础LLM的梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计LLM的语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，因为获得稳定估计通常需要大量昂贵的生成。

Method: 使用自然语言推理模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，通过重要性重加权和方差缩减技术来消除偏差。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法达到或超过基线性能，同时用相同样本数量覆盖更多语义簇。

Conclusion: 该框架作为模块化增强方案，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [81] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了NLP模型在字符顺序混乱（typoglycemia）情况下的鲁棒性，发现英语中较少单词会因此混淆，且混淆单词的上下文差异明显，使得消歧变得简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解NLP模型在字符顺序混乱时仍能保持良好性能的原因，特别是当多个不同单词（如form和from）在typoglycemia下变为相同表示时。

Method: 方法包括：(i)分析英国国家语料库以量化typoglycemia下的单词混淆和歧义；(ii)评估BERT消歧混淆形式的能力；(iii)通过对比在干净和typoglycemic维基百科文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 结果显示，字符顺序混乱导致的性能下降比预期要小，表明模型对此类干扰具有较强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结论是英语中单词混淆较少且混淆单词的上下文差异显著，这解释了NLP模型在typoglycemia下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是首个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修订行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重性和旅行者容忍度等维度，评估LLM对航班取消、天气关闭等事件的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但缺乏对现实旅行中断的处理能力。TripTide旨在填补这一空白，评估LLM在旅行中断情况下的适应性和韧性。

Method: 采用三重评估方法：1）引入自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2）使用LLM作为评判者自动评估修订质量；3）进行手动专家评估验证语义、空间、序列和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: 实验显示LLM在序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，但空间偏差在短途旅行中较大，随行程延长而减小。然而，随着计划长度增加，中断处理能力下降，表明LLM鲁棒性存在局限。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前LLM在长行程中断处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

*Qiang Liu,Wuganjing Song,Zhenzhou Lin,Feifan Chen,Qiaolong Cai,Chen Li,Yongduo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练在推理任务中比多轮训练更有效，单轮训练的模型能很好地泛化到单轮和多轮评估，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用通常涉及多轮人机交互反馈，而大型语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，这可能导致训练与部署条件不匹配。研究旨在探讨多轮训练是否对推理任务必要。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮设置下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都表现良好，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。多轮训练仅提供有限益处，甚至可能损害推理能力。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练仅提供有限益处且可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的手写问答基准数据集，用于测试多语言模型对瑞典特定知识的掌握程度，发现具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多瑞典基准测试是翻译自美国中心的基准，不适合测试与瑞典特别相关或特定于瑞典的知识，因此需要创建专门针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准。

Method: 研究人员手动编写了一个针对瑞典相关人物和事件的问答基准数据集，标注者从瑞典文化媒体名人参与的流行广播节目和主要体育赛事中获取灵感，数据集包含英语翻译，可用于测量不同规模和瑞典覆盖度的模型的事实回忆能力。

Result: 研究发现，具有更强瑞典覆盖度的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当；继续在瑞典语上进行预训练通常能提高事实知识，但也会导致部分先前已知信息的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集具有作为诊断工具的潜力，可用于研究多语言模型中的语言适应和知识保留问题。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

TL;DR: SindBERT是首个基于RoBERTa的大规模土耳其语编码器模型，在312GB土耳其语文本上训练，在多项NLP任务中表现具有竞争力，但大型变体未显示出持续扩展优势，表明当前土耳其语基准可能已饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形态丰富语言在大规模预训练中代表性不足的问题，为土耳其语NLP提供首个大规模编码器模型。

Method: 基于RoBERTa架构，在312GB土耳其语文本（mC4、OSCAR23、维基百科）上从头训练，发布基础和大型两种配置。

Result: 在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现具有竞争力，大型变体在两项任务中得分最高但无持续扩展优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT为土耳其语NLP提供了开放资源，同时作为实证案例研究揭示了扩展的局限性以及语料库组成在形态丰富语言中的核心作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Conclusion: HalleluBERT展示了完全收敛的单语言预训练的优势，为希伯来语NLP提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced NLP, yet Hebrew still lacks a
large-scale RoBERTa encoder which is extensively trained. Existing models such
as HeBERT, AlephBERT, and HeRo are limited by corpus size, vocabulary, or
training depth. We present HalleluBERT, a RoBERTa-based encoder family (base

Wikipedia with a Hebrew-specific byte-level BPE vocabulary. Evaluated on NER
and sentiment classification benchmarks, HalleluBERT outperforms both
monolingual and multilingual baselines. HalleluBERT sets a new state of the art
for Hebrew and highlights the benefits of fully converged monolingual
pretraining.

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在推理性能上落后于自回归大语言模型，主要原因是去噪过程中掩码token的独立生成未能捕捉token相关性。

Method: 提出多奖励优化方法，利用测试时缩放、拒绝采样和强化学习直接优化token相关性，并引入组步长和重要性采样策略来减少奖励方差和提高采样效率。

Result: 实验表明MRO不仅提高了推理性能，还在保持推理基准测试高性能的同时实现了显著的采样加速。

Conclusion: 增强token相关性是提升扩散语言模型推理性能的关键，MRO方法有效解决了这一问题并实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言行为上存在显著差异，但语言谱系结构在这种差异中的作用尚未充分探索。本研究旨在调查LLMs是否对语言谱系结构表现出敏感性。

Method: 通过扩展对MultiQ数据集的先前分析，首先检查当提示语言保真度未保持时，模型是否倾向于切换到谱系相关语言；然后调查知识一致性在谱系内部是否比跨谱系更好。

Conclusion: LLMs编码了谱系级别结构的某些方面，但训练数据不平衡仍然是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

*Mojca Brglez,Špela Vintar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了斯洛文尼亚语的首个语用理解基准SloPragEval和SloPragMega，包含405个选择题，用于评估语言模型在语用学方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型能力的提升，需要更具挑战性的评估来超越表层语言能力，特别是语用学理解，即理解情境意义、语境以及语言和文化规范。

Method: 构建了包含405个选择题的斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准，讨论了翻译困难，建立了人类基线，并进行了语言模型的试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达中隐含的说话者意义方面仍有困难，特别是文化特定的表达。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准必须精心设计，最好基于本地数据构建，并通过人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出无监督异常检测方法，用于识别词汇表中的音系不一致性，以检测转录错误和未记录的借词，应用于多语言Kokborok方言与孟加拉语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言文档中的词汇数据收集常包含转录错误和未记录的借词，这些会误导语言分析，需要系统方法来提高数据质量。

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音系特征的无监督异常检测算法，识别词汇表中的音系不一致性。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法，虽然精确率和召回率由于异常的微妙性质而保持适中，但高召回率方法为实地工作者提供了系统验证标记方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言文档提供了支持数据质量改进的系统方法，能够有效标记需要验证的条目。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning)方法，通过构建分析框架、组织和评分证据来增强大语言模型在股票预测任务中的推理能力，解决了现有模型过度依赖分析师观点而缺乏独立分析逻辑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现出色，但在金融领域的股票预测任务中应用不足。现有模型存在两个问题：过度依赖分析师观点而非独立分析逻辑；未能充分权衡对立证据，限制了预测的可靠性。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动训练。该方法在生成思维链时，动态构建分析框架，基于框架而非上下文观点来组织和评分支持股价上涨或下跌的证据，最后通过反思得出预测。

Result: 构建了大规模数据集，涵盖2024年全年5123只A股股票，包含长上下文（32K tokens）和超过20万样本。实验表明RETuning成功释放了模型在金融领域的推理能力，即使在6个月后或分布外股票上仍能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: RETuning方法通过最大化模型与学习到的分析框架的对齐，确保独立逻辑推理并减少上下文的不当影响，为金融领域的股票预测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出信息流追踪（IF-Track）方法，使用大语言模型作为概率编码器来量化推理过程中每一步的信息熵和信息增益，首次在单一度量空间内统一建模人类推理行为的普遍景观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解信息在人类推理中如何动态积累和转化长期以来一直是认知心理学、哲学和人工智能的挑战。现有方法从经典逻辑到概率模型，虽然揭示了输出或个体建模的某些方面，但未能提供统一的、定量的人类推理动态描述。

Method: 引入信息流追踪（IF-Track）方法，使用大语言模型作为概率编码器，在推理过程的每一步量化信息熵和信息增益。通过跨多个任务的细粒度分析，该方法在单一度量空间内建模人类推理行为。

Result: IF-Track能够捕捉基本的推理特征，识别系统性错误模式，并表征个体差异。在应用高级心理学理论讨论中，该方法首次在IF-Track框架下调和了单过程与双过程理论，发现了人工与人类认知的对齐，以及大语言模型如何重塑人类推理过程。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论与测量之间建立了定量桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性洞见。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

TL;DR: GMFlowRec是一个用于多域序列推荐的高效生成框架，通过高斯混合流匹配建模域感知转换轨迹，在JD和Amazon数据集上实现了最先进的性能，NDCG@5提升高达44%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在多域中的交互行为日益频繁复杂，现有跨域序列推荐方法往往忽略域转换的复杂性，容易对密集域过拟合而对稀疏域欠拟合，且难以扩展到更多域。

Method: 提出GMFlowRec框架：1）统一双掩码Transformer分离域不变和域特定意图；2）高斯混合流场捕捉多样化行为模式；3）域对齐先验支持频繁和稀疏转换。

Result: 在JD和Amazon数据集上的广泛实验表明，GMFlowRec实现了最先进的性能，NDCG@5提升高达44%，同时通过单一统一骨干保持高效率。

Conclusion: GMFlowRec是一个可扩展的高效多域序列推荐框架，能有效处理域异质性和不平衡问题，适用于现实世界的多域推荐场景。

Abstract: Users increasingly interact with content across multiple domains, resulting
in sequential behaviors marked by frequent and complex transitions. While
Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) models two-domain interactions,
Multi-Domain Sequential Recommendation (MDSR) introduces significantly more
domain transitions, compounded by challenges such as domain heterogeneity and
imbalance. Existing approaches often overlook the intricacies of domain
transitions, tend to overfit to dense domains while underfitting sparse ones,
and struggle to scale effectively as the number of domains increases. We
propose \textit{GMFlowRec}, an efficient generative framework for MDSR that
models domain-aware transition trajectories via Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching.
GMFlowRec integrates: (1) a unified dual-masked Transformer to disentangle
domain-invariant and domain-specific intents, (2) a Gaussian Mixture flow field
to capture diverse behavioral patterns, and (3) a domain-aligned prior to
support frequent and sparse transitions. Extensive experiments on JD and Amazon
datasets demonstrate that GMFlowRec achieves state-of-the-art performance with
up to 44\% improvement in NDCG@5, while maintaining high efficiency via a
single unified backbone, making it scalable for real-world multi-domain
sequential recommendation.

Conclusion: 增强现实技术能够有效帮助非语言自闭症儿童进行沟通，整合性平台比零散方法更适合自闭症儿童的需求。

Abstract: This paper discusses the issue regarding Non-verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder.
It has been observed that this mental disorder is listed in major parts of the
world including the US, UK, and India. To mitigate this type of disorder, a
wide range of smartphones, computers, and artificial intelligence technologies
have been used. This technology has helped the population cope with
socialization and communication needs. Many applications have been developed to
enhance the communication capabilities of non-verbal autistic children. This
thesis project proposes the development of a platform that includes a web panel
and an Android mobile application to assist non-verbal autistic children in
communication, especially in Oman. Different interventions have been merged to
improve the quality of life for people on the autism spectrum. The main problem
identified in this case is that fragmented approaches are not suitable for
autistic children. The augmented reality framework provides the capability to
engage autistic children in creative play and self-reflection through
interactive screen-based activities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有多模态对话推荐数据集存在模拟对话、忽略用户历史或反馈不详细等限制，无法支持全面的研究和评估。

Method: 构建包含60个人类对话的VOGUE数据集，每个对话配有共享视觉目录、物品元数据、用户时尚档案和历史记录，以及对话后评分。

Result: 分析显示视觉基础对话具有独特动态，推荐者经常按特征分组建议物品；MLLMs在整体对齐上接近人类水平，但在重现人类评分分布和泛化偏好推理方面存在系统误差。

Conclusion: VOGUE为研究多模态对话系统提供了独特资源，并成为超越当前顶级多模态基础模型推荐能力的挑战数据集。

Abstract: Multimodal conversational recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
for delivering personalized experiences through natural dialogue enriched by
visual and contextual grounding. Yet, current multimodal conversational
recommendation datasets remain limited: existing resources either simulate
conversations, omit user history, or fail to collect sufficiently detailed
feedback, all of which constrain the types of research and evaluation they
support.
  To address these gaps, we introduce VOGUE, a novel dataset of 60 humanhuman
dialogues in realistic fashion shopping scenarios. Each dialogue is paired with
a shared visual catalogue, item metadata, user fashion profiles and histories,
and post-conversation ratings from both Seekers and Assistants. This design
enables rigorous evaluation of conversational inference, including not only
alignment between predicted and ground-truth preferences, but also calibration
against full rating distributions and comparison with explicit and implicit
user satisfaction signals.
  Our initial analyses of VOGUE reveal distinctive dynamics of visually
grounded dialogue. For example, recommenders frequently suggest items
simultaneously in feature-based groups, which creates distinct conversational
phases bridged by Seeker critiques and refinements. Benchmarking multimodal
large language models against human recommenders shows that while MLLMs
approach human-level alignment in aggregate, they exhibit systematic
distribution errors in reproducing human ratings and struggle to generalize
preference inference beyond explicitly discussed items. These findings
establish VOGUE as both a unique resource for studying multimodal
conversational systems and as a challenge dataset beyond the current
recommendation capabilities of existing top-tier multimodal foundation models
such as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash.

TL;DR: BLOGER是一个用于生成式推荐的双层优化框架，通过统一优化分词器和推荐器来解决现有方法中两者分离导致的标识符与推荐目标不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法将分词器和推荐器分开优化（顺序或交替），忽略了它们之间的相互依赖关系，导致分词器训练缺乏推荐目标的直接指导，产生次优标识符从而降低推荐性能。

Method: 提出BLOGER框架，采用双层优化：下层使用分词序列训练推荐器，上层基于分词损失和推荐损失优化分词器。使用元学习方法高效求解，并引入梯度手术缓解上层更新中的梯度冲突。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，BLOGER持续优于最先进的生成式推荐方法，同时保持实际效率，没有显著增加计算开销。

Conclusion: BLOGER有效弥合了项目分词和自回归生成之间的差距，确保项目标识符既信息丰富又与推荐目标一致。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a transformative paradigm by
directly generating recommended items, rather than relying on matching.
Building such a system typically involves two key components: (1) optimizing
the tokenizer to derive suitable item identifiers, and (2) training the
recommender based on those identifiers. Existing approaches often treat these
components separately--either sequentially or in alternation--overlooking their
interdependence. This separation can lead to misalignment: the tokenizer is
trained without direct guidance from the recommendation objective, potentially
yielding suboptimal identifiers that degrade recommendation performance.
  To address this, we propose BLOGER, a Bi-Level Optimization for GEnerative
Recommendation framework, which explicitly models the interdependence between
the tokenizer and the recommender in a unified optimization process. The lower
level trains the recommender using tokenized sequences, while the upper level
optimizes the tokenizer based on both the tokenization loss and recommendation
loss. We adopt a meta-learning approach to solve this bi-level optimization
efficiently, and introduce gradient surgery to mitigate gradient conflicts in
the upper-level updates, thereby ensuring that item identifiers are both
informative and recommendation-aligned. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BLOGER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
generative recommendation methods while maintaining practical efficiency with
no significant additional computational overhead, effectively bridging the gap
between item tokenization and autoregressive generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种个性化上下文感知分词器，用于生成推荐模型中的语义ID，解决了现有静态分词方法忽略用户个性化视角的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成推荐模型中的分词方法是静态且非个性化的，仅基于物品特征生成语义ID，假设存在通用的物品相似性标准，忽略了用户特定的意图和偏好。

Method: 提出个性化上下文感知分词器，在生成语义ID时融入用户的历史交互信息，使同一物品在不同用户上下文中被分词为不同的语义ID。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，相比非个性化动作分词基线，NDCG@10指标提升了最高11.44%。

Conclusion: 个性化上下文感知分词器能够使生成推荐模型捕捉多种解释标准，产生更个性化的预测，显著提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于相关性的序列推荐系统仅关注项目共现，忽略了用户行为背后的因果动机，导致虚假相关性和不准确推荐。

Method: CausalRec包含因果发现模块学习用户行为序列的因果图，以及因果增强器利用发现的因果图优化注意力机制，优先考虑具有因果重要性的行为。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，CausalRec优于多个最先进方法，HR平均提升7.21%，NDCG平均提升8.65%。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过注意力机制整合因果关系的序列推荐模型，证明了因果关系在生成更准确可靠推荐中的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have
demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model
outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both
short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on
item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,
leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal
attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal
discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the
causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee
the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the
discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing
behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world
datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,
with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in
sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating
more accurate and reliable recommendations.

Conclusion: SciNUP数据集为基于自然语言档案的推荐系统研究提供了有价值的资源，有助于推动该领域的未来发展。

Abstract: The use of natural language (NL) user profiles in recommender systems offers
greater transparency and user control compared to traditional representations.
However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections
for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we
introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that
leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and
corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison
of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to
state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline
methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items,
indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for
improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based
recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable
resource for fostering future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Multilingual e-commerce search suffers from severe data imbalance across
languages, label noise, and limited supervision for low-resource
languages--challenges that impede the cross-lingual generalization of relevance
models despite the strong capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we present a practical, architecture-agnostic, data-centric framework to
enhance performance on two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance (matching
queries to product categories) and Query-Item (QI) relevance (matching queries
to product titles). Rather than altering the model, we redesign the training
data through three complementary strategies: (1) translation-based augmentation
to synthesize examples for languages absent in training, (2) semantic negative
sampling to generate hard negatives and mitigate class imbalance, and (3)
self-validation filtering to detect and remove likely mislabeled instances.
Evaluated on the CIKM AnalytiCup 2025 dataset, our approach consistently yields
substantial F1 score improvements over strong LLM baselines, achieving
competitive results in the official competition. Our findings demonstrate that
systematic data engineering can be as impactful as--and often more deployable
than--complex model modifications, offering actionable guidance for building
robust multilingual search systems in the real-world e-commerce settings.

Motivation: 传统模糊数运算存在三个主要问题：高计算复杂度、运算结果可能不保持原模糊集特征、模糊扩散现象，这些限制了模糊数的应用范围。

Method: 采用外延模糊数替代传统模糊集表示，定义了外延模糊数的运算方法（包括算术运算和关系操作符=、>、>=、<、<=），并提供了C++实现。

Conclusion: 外延模糊数为模糊数运算提供了一种更高效和一致的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性，扩展了模糊数的应用领域。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体框架，用于将自然语言问题准确翻译为空间SQL查询，通过程序化模式分析和语义增强的知识库、上下文检索嵌入以及协作多智能体管道，显著提高了空间查询的准确性和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SQL复杂性和PostGIS等工具中地理空间函数专业化带来的障碍，使非专家能够更容易地进行空间数据分析，同时克服单智能体方法在处理空间查询语义和语法复杂性方面的局限性。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查智能体等专门组件，通过程序化模式分析和语义增强的知识库、上下文检索嵌入以及协作管道实现查询翻译和验证。

Result: 在KaggleDBQA基准测试中达到81.2%的总体准确率（272个问题中的221个），在空间查询中达到87.7%的准确率（90个问题中的79个），相比没有审查智能体时的76.7%有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作使空间分析更加易于访问，为空间Text-to-SQL系统提供了稳健、可推广的基础，推动了自主GIS的发展，并在某些情况下生成比基准更符合用户意图的查询。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个针对医学视觉问答的新框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在临床部署中的幻觉、推理效率低和多机构协作难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在智能医疗中具有潜力，但面临三个关键挑战：幻觉回答、固定深度推理效率低、多机构协作困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化目标，设计检索感知专家混合架构，采用联邦治理机制进行本地元认知不确定性估计和迭代思维链推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上实现最先进性能，比强检索增强基线F1分数提升11.85%，平均推理长度比固定深度CoT方法减少51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign通过视觉对齐、专家路由和自适应推理，有效解决了LVLM在临床部署中的关键挑战，为智能医疗应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过分析LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化，生成对抗性外部知识来毒化检索增强生成系统，能够有效解决知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法主要关注检索内容或提示结构的迭代操作，忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突机制。

Method: 首先识别与上下文毒化知识强相关的毒化响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法演化最大化激活这些神经元的对抗性段落，并通过观察归因信号重用有潜力但最初未成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法持续实现超过90%的人口覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性，有效解决了知识冲突问题。

Conclusion: NeuroGenPoisoning框架通过神经元归因引导的毒化能够大规模生成有效的毒化RAG知识，并有效解决知识冲突，揭示了RAG毒化的深层机制。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt是一个自动化框架，通过进化图优化方法自动设计更好的提示和推理过程，在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中显著优于现有方法，并提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在领域特定任务中为大型语言模型设计最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决如何整合领域知识、提高推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合指导等关键问题。

Method: EGO-Prompt从专家构建的初始语义因果图开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程生成确定性推理指导，并调整LLM以有效利用该指导，使用迭代优化算法基于真实数据精炼语义因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在真实世界的公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法F1得分提高7.32%-12.61%，使小型模型以不到20%的成本达到大型模型的性能，并输出精炼的领域特定语义因果图。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt成功解决了领域特定提示设计的挑战，通过自动化优化过程显著提升了LLM性能，同时提供了更好的可解释性和成本效益。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

TL;DR: SSoT是一种新颖的提示方法，通过让LLM先生成随机字符串来增加熵，然后从中提取随机性来生成最终答案，从而改善概率指令跟随性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现出色，但在概率指令跟随任务中表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用（如人类行为模拟、内容多样化、多人游戏）和响应多样性。

Method: 提出SSoT方法：首先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵守特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的概率指令跟随性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能；在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够改善LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的表现，并增强响应多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

TL;DR: NuSA-CL是一个轻量级、无内存的持续学习框架，通过低秩适应和空空间约束来保护预训练视觉语言模型的零样本能力，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法在不遗忘旧知识的情况下适应新环境。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能，计算和内存开销极小。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Motivation: 随着AI自主系统能力增强，确保其安全性变得至关重要，而OOD检测是应对系统生命周期中不确定情况的关键技术。

Method: 通过综合文献回顾，定义相关概念，分析OOD成因，识别适用于ML开发全生命周期的检测技术。

Result: 识别了一系列可在ML开发生命周期中使用的OOD检测技术，并提出了在安全保证论证中的适用场景。

Conclusion: OOD检测对自主系统安全至关重要，但仍需解决技术挑战并建立系统化方法以确保安全运行。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度不鲁棒，在具有密集奖励的游戏中使用固定λ值会导致性能问题。需要开发对奖励尺度不敏感的λ选择策略。

Method: 评估文献中已有的λ策略，并提出五种新策略，包括基于Q值标准差的λ=2σ方法。通过实验比较这些策略在不同任务上的表现。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务中表现最佳，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能都优于现有策略。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择方法，该方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，在保持有效推理链的同时引导模型回到安全轨迹，显著提升大型推理模型的安全性而不牺牲推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往会抑制推理能力，无法解决安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过分析不同LRMs的推理轨迹，发现Self-Jailbreak现象，即模型会推翻自己的风险评估并为响应不安全提示辩护。基于此提出CoG训练框架，重新组合或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提高了当前LRMs的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: LRMs本身具备拒绝不安全查询的能力，但这种能力被削弱导致有害输出。CoG框架能够有效解决安全性与推理能力之间的权衡，为LRMs的安全部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要采用技术中心方法，重点关注可靠性、鲁棒性和公平性等技术属性，而忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度在不同研究领域中的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值。

Result: 虽然在定义透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性方面取得了显著进展，但研究发现存在关键差距。当前研究往往过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会和伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质仍较少被探索，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的有争议概念。

Conclusion: 结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法对于推进可信AI至关重要。建议AI伦理社区采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的整体框架，促进惠及所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观察环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致代码生成不准确或不完整，影响任务成功率。

Method: 结合显式符号验证和交互验证过程，在验证阶段生成探索性代码与环境交互获取缺失观察，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观察场景中，任务成功率比Code-as-Policies基线提高46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强代码生成的环境基础，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Result: 在各种CXR解读任务上的实验表明，CXRAgent表现出强大的性能，能够提供视觉证据，并能很好地泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过导演协调的多阶段架构，结合工具可靠性验证和专家团队协作，显著提升了CXR分析的适应性、可信度和推理能力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

### [119] [Magellan: Guided MCTS for Latent Space Exploration and Novelty Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21341)
*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan是一个基于蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)的创新生成框架，通过分层引导系统解决LLMs在创造性思维中的局限性，显著提升了科学创意的合理性和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在生成真正创新想法时往往局限于训练数据中的高概率概念，现有方法如思维树(ToT)依赖不可靠的自评估启发式方法，存在根本性限制。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)作为核心算法，配备分层引导系统：长程方向由基于正交投影的"语义指南针"向量引导，局部决策由景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自评估。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Magellan在生成科学创意方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线方法，在合理性和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对于创造性发现，有原则的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLMs成为创新中更有能力的合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

### [120] [AutoOpt: A Dataset and a Unified Framework for Automating Optimization Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21436)
*Ankur Sinha,Shobhit Arora,Dhaval Pujara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoOpt-11k是一个包含11,000多个手写和打印数学优化模型图像的数据集，以及AutoOpt框架——一个基于机器学习的自动化优化问题求解系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题需要人工建模和求解的复杂过程，开发一个能够从图像自动识别并求解优化问题的自动化系统。

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型将优化问题图像转换为LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX代码转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解PYOMO脚本描述的优化问题。

Result: MER任务中的深度学习模型在BLEU分数指标上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法等常见方法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt-11k数据集和AutoOpt框架为自动化求解数学优化问题提供了有效的解决方案，在图像识别和复杂问题求解方面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

TL;DR: Co-Sight通过冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实机制，将推理转化为可证伪和可审计的过程，在长程推理任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在长程推理中因中间推理验证不足而失败的问题，而非生成能力不足。

Method: 采用冲突感知元验证和可信推理结构化事实两个互补机制：CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体的可靠长程推理提供了可扩展的范式，结构化事实基础与冲突感知验证的协同作用驱动了性能提升。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

### [122] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用隐式分类学习（ICL）训练神经控制屏障函数（CBF）的方法，用于在故障状态集难以明确定义的情况下保证自主系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统中，安全性是基本要求。传统基于优化的CBF合成计算成本高，且故障状态集往往难以明确定义（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题），而专家演示数据更容易获得。

Method: 使用ICL训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全（属于与未指定故障集不相交的受控前向不变集）或不安全，然后用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四个不同环境中进行实证评估，表明该方法优于现有基线，并且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的替代方案，能够在故障状态集难以明确定义的情况下有效学习安全约束，为自主系统安全控制提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [123] [CMOMgen: Complex Multi-Ontology Alignment via Pattern-Guided In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21656)
*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。该方法在三个生物医学任务中表现优异，在类选择上优于基线方法，并在两个任务中F1分数达到63%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来将数据完全语境化到特定领域。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，因此需要更复杂的多本体匹配方法来建立更细致的等价关系和本体层次上的溯源。

Method: CMOMgen采用检索增强生成方法，选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例，以增强上下文学习。这是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，不限制目标本体或实体的数量。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务的评估中，CMOMgen在类选择上优于基线方法。在两个任务中F1分数达到63%以上，优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。对非参考映射的手动评估显示，46%的映射获得了最高分，进一步证实了其构建语义合理映射的能力。

Conclusion: CMOMgen是首个能够生成完整且语义合理的复杂多本体映射的端到端策略，在生物医学领域的多个任务中表现出色，证明了专用策略在复杂多本体匹配中的重要性。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的专家标注视频广告数据集，旨在分析能源公司公关活动中的框架类型，特别关注绿色创新等环境信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业投入大量资金进行公关活动以塑造正面品牌形象，但有时存在言行不一的问题（如石油天然气公司的"漂绿"现象）。理解大规模框架及其变化有助于更好理解公关活动的目标和性质。

Method: 构建了一个从Facebook和YouTube获取的专家标注视频广告数据集，包含13种框架类型的标注，涵盖20个国家的50多家公司或倡导团体，专门用于视觉语言模型评估。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息，F1分数达79%，但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅获得46%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源领域战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时指出了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战，如隐含框架处理、不同长度视频处理和文化背景理解。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于解决自主智能体在动态环境中高层任务目标与低层规划输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。该框架通过知识图谱作为智能翻译层，将声明性事实编译为每个智能体的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主智能体在动态环境中的协调受到高层任务目标与低层规划输入之间语义鸿沟的阻碍，需要一种能够智能翻译和协调的方法。

Method: 引入基于知识图谱的框架，采用双平面架构将声明性事实编译为每个智能体的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 通过墨西哥湾自主水下航行器的案例研究，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大、有状态编排器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.
